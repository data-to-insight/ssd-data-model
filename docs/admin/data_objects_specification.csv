AUT - ‘DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM OR ASPERGER SYNDROME’ – diagnosed by a qualified medical practitioner as having classical autism or Asperger syndrome. Do not include children who have merely been identified as having an autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), for example by their school. This can be associated with the behaviour and learning categories above. 
DDA - ‘OTHER DDA’ – one or more of the child’s disabilities under the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 (DDA) does not fall into any of the above categories. 

Certain conditions are not regarded as impairments for the purposes of the act: 
• addiction to, or dependency on, alcohol, nicotine, or any other substance (other than as a result of the substance being medically prescribed); 
• the condition known as seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), except where it aggravates the effect of another condition; 
• tendency to start fires; 
• tendency to steal; 
• tendency to physically or sexually abuse other persons; 
• exhibitionism; 
• voyeurism 
In addition, disfigurements such as tattoos, non-medical body piercing, or something attached through such piercing, are not regarded as having a substantial adverse effect on the person’s ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities. 
If a child is disabled or becomes disabled at any time during the collection year, record all the relevant disabilities that have affected the child. For example, children may have multiple disabilities in which case more than one category from the below list can be selected. ‘Other DDA’ can also be used in conjunction with any of the other categories.
If your MIS does not allow for the identification of individual disabilities, then the code ‘Other DDA’ may be used for all children with a disability.

This code indicates the main reason why a child started to receive services. 
The categories are designed only to identify what kind of pressures are placed on social services. They have no diagnostic value with regard to the children themselves and must not be used to determine what type of service the child should receive.
If there is difficulty choosing between two or more categories of need, choose the category that comes highest up in the table, for example, if trying to decide between family in acute stress and family dysfunction, choose family in acute stress.
The order of the categories relates to the specificity of the description and not necessarily importance. However, the order is fixed so that there is consistency.
The children in need census for 2005 and earlier tried to account for all money spent in a census week. To allow for this, ‘N9’ was created, but as this census is specifically child based, the definition of ‘N9’ from 2005 is not applicable. As in previous years, ‘N9’ can be used if a child is no longer in need and the only service they are receiving is adoption support (on an open case) immediately after they have been in need.
Code Set
N1 - Abuse or neglect
Children in need as a result of, or at risk of, abuse or neglect; also includes children at risk because of domestic violence.
N2 - Child’s disability
Children and families whose main need for services arises because of their child’s disability, illness or intrinsic condition.
N3 - Parental disability or illness
Children whose main need for services arises because the capacity of their parent(s) (or carer(s)) to care for them is impaired by the parent(s) (or carer(s)) disability, physical or mental illness, or addictions.
N4 - Family in acute stress
Children whose needs arise from living in a family that is going through a temporary crisis that diminishes the parental capacity to adequately meet some of the children’s needs.
N5 - Family dysfunction
Children whose needs primarily arise from living in a family where the parenting capacity is chronically inadequate.
N6 - Socially unacceptable behaviour
Children and families whose need for services primarily arise out of the child’s behaviour impacting detrimentally on the community.
N7 - Low income
Children, living in families or independently, whose needs primarily arise from being dependent on an income below the standard state entitlements.
N8 - Absent parenting
Children whose needs for services arise mainly from having no parents available to provide for them.
N9 - Cases other than children in need
Children who have been adopted and, although they are no longer a child in need, receive adoption support from children’s social services immediately after adoption. This should not be used where a child receives an adoption payment only.
N0 - Not stated

S - Started to be looked after
L - Change of legal status only

T - Change of placement (but same carer(s)) only
B - Change of legal status and placement and carer(s) at the same time
U - Change of legal status and change of placement (but same carer(s)) at the same time

Use Code S where a child is starting to be looked-after for the first time, or had previously ceased to be looked-after, and is now starting to be looked-after again. 
Also use code S when recording agreements to provide short-term placements (legal status V4), and for individual breaks under such an agreement, if these are being recorded separately (legal status V3).
Use Code L where there is a change of legal status, but the placement does not change. By ‘legal status’ we mean the legal status underlying the fact that the child is looked-after.
Use Code P where there is a change of placement and carer, but the legal status does not change. This would include the following scenarios:
• Move from one foster carer to another foster carer (for example, U3 to another U3 placement type code).
• Move from a foster carer to a children’s home (for example, U3 to K2 placement types).
In both scenarios there has been a change of carer. When a child is living independently, a new episode should be created each time they move, and code P should be used.
Use Code T where there is a change of placement, but the child remains with the same carer and the legal status does not change. This would include the following scenarios:
• Child moves to a new house with current foster carer (either inside or outside of local authority boundary).
• Child remains with same carer or within same setting but either the URN of the setting changes or the provider type changes (for example, a foster carer moves from an IFA to the local authority provider, or a placement for adoption transferring to a regional adoption agency, or an unregulated independent or 
semi independent setting registering with Ofsted).
In both scenarios, the child has remained with the same carer, but for some other reason, a new placement is required on the SSDA903.
Use Code B where both legal status and placement change, with a change of carer, on the same day. The two changes do not need to be simultaneous or consequent one upon the other. The code simply reflects that there was a change in carer and a change in legal status, for whatever reason, on the same day.
Use Code U where both legal status and placement change on the same day, but the child remains with the same carer. The two changes do not need to be simultaneous or consequent one upon the other. The code simply reflects that there was a change in placement and a change in legal status, for whatever reason, on the same day.",,FACT_CARE_EPISODES.CARE_REASON_DESC,DataTesting,,See 'Episode ID' note,"Not held - for statutory reporting purposes it is derived based on the change or otherwise of legal status, placement or placement service.",Calculated field (see 'Episode ID' note)

N6 - Socially unacceptable behaviour

If a child ceases to be looked-after because he/she has turned 18, this can already be deduced from his/her date of birth. Therefore, the appropriate code below should be used to capture the destination of the young person.
X1   - Episode ceases, and new episode begins on same day, for any reason
E11 - Adopted - application for an adoption order unopposed
E12 - Adopted – consent dispensed with by the court
E2   - Died

E13 - Left care to live with parent(s), relative(s), or other person(s) with no parental responsibility.
E41 - Residence order/ child arrangement order which sets out with whom the child is to live) granted
E45 - Special guardianship order made to former foster carer(s), who was/are a relative(s) or friend(s)
E46 - Special guardianship order made to former foster carer(s), other than relative(s) or friend(s)
E47 - Special guardianship order made to carer(s), other than former foster carer(s), who was/are a relative(s) or friend(s)

E5   - Moved into independent living arrangement and no longer looked-after: supportive accommodation providing formalised advice/support arrangements (such as most hostels, young men’s Christian association, foyers, staying close and care leavers projects). Includes both children leaving care before and at age 18
E6  - Moved into independent living arrangement and no longer looked-after: accommodation providing no formalised advice/support arrangements (such as bedsit, own flat, living with friend(s)). Includes both children leaving care before and at age 18
E7   - Transferred to residential care funded by adult social care services
E9   - Sentenced to custody
E14 - Accommodation on remand ended
E15 - Age assessment determined child is aged 18 or over and E5, E6 and E7 do not apply, such as an unaccompanied asylum-seeking child (UASC) whose age has been disputed
E16 - Child moved abroad
E17 - Aged 18 (or over) and remained with current carers (inc under staying put arrangements)
E8   - Period of being looked-after ceased for any other reason (where none of the other reasons apply)

Further detail on when some of the codes should be used is provided below:
E4A - Relates to a planned move where the child returns home as part of their agreed care plan. This return home has been discussed as part of the care planning process and happens within a planned timeframe.
E4B - Relates to an unplanned move - includes instances where the child’s return home is immediate (for example, within 24 hours) and has not been discussed as part of the care planning process or does not occur within the planned timeframe. This would include instances where a child under a voluntary arrangement is removed from care by their parents and this was not agreed as part of the care planning process.
E13 - Left care to live with parents, relatives, or other person with no parental responsibility – this code should be used if the child left care to live with parents, relatives or another person, but this person did not have parental responsibility.
E14 - Accommodation on remand ended – this code should be used if a child was remanded to youth detention accommodation and has stopped their episode of care because they are no longer remanded.
E15 - Age assessment determined child is aged 18 or over and E5, E6 and E7 do not apply, for example, an unaccompanied asylum seeking child whose age has been disputed – this code should be used if the episode of care ended because the age was disputed, an assessment revealed the child was 18 or over and the young person was not transferred to residential care and did not move into independent living arrangements. 
E16 - Moved abroad – use this code if the child left care because they moved to another country, including when a child is deported.
E17 - Aged 18 (or over) and remained with current carers (inc under staying put arrangements) – use this code whenever the young person has ceased care and remains with their former carers, irrespective of placement type. Young people in foster care who are ‘staying put’ are only a subset of this group.
E8   - Period of being looked-after ceased for any other reason – this code should never be used purely because a child has reached the age of 18 as this can already be deduced from his/her date of birth. It should only be used when none of the alternative destinations listed are appropriate. E8 should also be used when a child turns 18 and continues to be missing.
If a looked-after child is sentenced to custody and placed in a secure children’s home, secure training centre or young offenders’ institution, their status in that setting depends on the legislative framework under which the custodial sentence is applied. If the child is subject to a Care Order (Section 31 Children Act 1989) then they remain looked-after regardless of being sentenced to custody. If the child is accommodated in care by a voluntary agreement under Section 20 of the Children Act 1989, then they cease to be looked-after when they are admitted to custody.",,FACT_CARE_EPISODES.CARE_REASON_END_DESC,DataTesting,,See 'Episode ID' note,"DM_CLA_SUMMARIES, DM_PLACEMENTS.REASON_EPISODE_CEASED",ChildrensReports.D.LACPlacements.ReasonPlacementCeased

For larger providers with multiple settings or branches the precise URN for the particular setting or branch is required.
In some cases, it will be valid to provide different information to that registered with Ofsted, for example if a child is placed at the provider but at a different postcode to the main site. This could be the case if a child is residing in a dormitory with a different postcode to the registered site. Here the actual postcode where the child resides should be reported.
The URN is in the format SC999999 or 9999999 for newly registered providers. Note that secure training centres may have both a 6-digit education URN and a 7-digit social care URN and it is the 7-digit social care URN which should be returned in the SSDA903. Where local authorities are certain that a provider is not inspected by Ofsted but is inspected by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) or Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) then the code ‘XXXXXXX’ should be used.

The reason for placement change should be recorded against the episode that is ceasing, not against the new episode starting.
Code set
CARPL - Change to/Implementation of Care Plan
This code would be used where the change of placement is a planned part of the child’s care plan and will be a move to a placement that meets the child’s assessed needs on a temporary or permanent basis. This would include circumstances where a placement change was not expected but becomes necessary. The key factor is that planning takes place and the decision is recorded in the child’s care plan before the change takes place. This would include moves from short to long term foster care or where a child is placed for adoption with the current foster carer. It also includes movements to semi-independence. The nature of the change in plan will be monitored through the placement codes before and after this move. This should not include changes where the foster carer has moved to a new house or where the carer is the same but has changed provider type.
CLOSE - Resignation/ closure of provision
This code would be used where a child has to be moved because a foster carer decides to resign or the setting closes. This code would be used in a planned move; not in an emergency. The foster carer’s decision to resign may be because their circumstances have changed, for example, the foster carer becomes ill or another change of circumstances means that the foster carer is no longer able to provide a placement for the child. Circumstances may also include where the child’s placement had lasted longer than expected and the foster carer is no longer able to provide a placement for the child. Use of this code would also include where a setting (for example, a children’s home or a fostering service) closes and is therefore no longer a registered provision with Ofsted.
ALLEG - Allegation (s47)
This code would be used where a child has been removed from placement because of an allegation which is being investigated under s47 (Children Act 1989). This allegation may relate to the carer or another child at the setting. This code should not be used if the allegation has resulted in the setting’s approval (for example, a children’s home or a fostering service) being terminated – in this case, ‘approval removed’ should be used.
STAND - Standards of care concern
This code would be used where a child has been removed from placement by the responsible authority or provider as a result of concerns about standards of care. This does not mean a child protection investigation (s47) but a formal process followed by the provider. For example, see the National Minimum Standards for Fostering Service 2011, standard. 22. This code can be used for all types of placement such as foster care, residential care. This code should not be used if the setting’s approval is terminated as a result of standards of care concerns – in this case, ‘approval removed’ should be used.
CUSTOD - Custody arrangement
This code would be used where a child has been admitted into custody.
APPRR   Approval removed
This code would be used where a setting is no longer approved/registered with the appropriate statutory body (such as Ofsted). This code can be used for all types of placement such as foster care, residential care. For example, this code should be used where a foster carer’s approval is terminated by the service following a s47 investigation, a standards of care issue, a complaint or for other reasons that relate to the carers’ conduct. It should also be used where Ofsted take enforcement action resulting in the closure of a residential setting. This code should not be used when a foster carer resigns or a provision is closed voluntarily and they are no longer registered with the relevant statutory body (such as Ofsted).
CREQB - Carer(s) requests placement end due to child’s behaviour
This code would be used where because of the child’s behaviour the placement has broken down or disrupted, and the carer has asked for the placement to end and the child to be moved to another placement. There may be some planning involved and a short period of time may pass but this is not a planned move.
CREQO - Carer(s) requests placement end other than due to child’s behaviour
These codes would be used where it was intended that the placement was a short or long term arrangement but has broken down or disrupted and the carer [foster carer, residential unit or connected person] has asked for the child to be moved to another placement. There may be some planning involved and a short period of time may pass but this is not a planned move.
CHILD - Child requests placement end
This code would be used where it was intended that the placement was a short- or long-term arrangement but has broken down or disrupted and the child has asked to move to another placement. There may be some planning involved and a short period of time may pass but this is not a planned move.
LAREQ - Responsible/area authority requests placement end
This code would be used where it was intended that the placement was a short- or long-term placement but the responsible authority has decided that the placement no longer meets the child’s needs. There may be some planning involved and a short period of time may pass but this is not a planned move. There will be circumstances where the child is at risk of harm and this would be coded as an allegation or standards of care concern. Where the placement no longer meets a child’s need but there is no immediate risk – this code would be used.
PLACE - Change in the status of placement only
This code would be used where there is a change of status for the placement, but the child remains with the same carer and there is no change to the care plan. Examples include a foster carer moving to a new house, a foster carer working for a local authority becomes managed by an independent fostering agency, a placement for adoption transferring to a regional adoption agency, or a child in residential accommodation moving under the same provider. Here the ‘reason for new episode’ code will indicate that the child is still living with the same carer.
OTHER - Other
