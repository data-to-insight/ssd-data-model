The condition must have lasted, or be likely to last at least 12 months in order to be counted as a disability.
Certain conditions are not regarded as impairments for the purposes of the act:
• addiction to, or dependency on, alcohol, nicotine, or any other substance (other than as a result of the substance being medically prescribed);
• the condition known as seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), except where it aggravates the effect of another condition;
• tendency to start fires;
• tendency to steal;
• tendency to physically or sexually abuse other persons;
• exhibitionism;
• voyeurism
In addition, disfigurements such as tattoos, non-medical body piercing, or something attached through such piercing, are not regarded as having a substantial adverse effect on the person’s ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.
If a child is disabled or becomes disabled at any time during the collection year, record all the relevant disabilities that have affected the child. For example, children may have multiple disabilities in which case more than one category from the below list can be selected. ‘Other DDA’ can also be used in conjunction with any of the other categories.
If your MIS does not allow for the identification of individual disabilities, then the code ‘Other DDA’ may be used for all children with a disability. However, this must be recorded in your COLLECT return level notes so your data can be analysed appropriately.
If a child has no disability, do not leave this item blank; use the code ‘NONE’. However, if a child is unborn then the disability item should be left blank. "

If a child is looked-after because it is accommodated, the legal status goes some way to describe (in legal terms at least) why the child is being looked after. There are many legal statuses arising from the Children Act, or the Youth Justice System, to which a child can be subject, but which have no bearing on whether a child is ‘looked-after’ or not. These are not recorded on the SSDA903, and no legal status codes are provided for them.
The renewal of an existing legal status does not automatically generate a new episode. If the legal status code does not change, a new episode is not required (unless there happens to be a change of placement at the same time).
Example: If a child is already looked-after under an interim care order, a renewal of the interim care order does not change the legal status and no new episode is required. However, if a child looked-after under an interim care order becomes the subject of a full care order, then a new episode is required to record the start of the full care order.
In certain circumstances a child being looked-after can have more than one ‘lookedafter’ legal status. In general, this happens when a child who is already ‘looked-after’ under a Children Act care order comes into contact with the Youth Justice System, and as a result is detained in local authority accommodation under a second legal status. Two legal statuses cannot be shown as current on SSDA903. In such cases the latest legal status should be recorded and the episode under the previous status should be closed
Example: A child who is already subject to a care order is remanded to local authority accommodation under Section 23 (1) of CYPA 1969. The care order episode should be closed, and a new episode should start under the “remanded to local authority accommodation” legal status code. When the episode under the remand status ends, a further episode under the care order legal status will start, unless the care order has been discharged.
We have attempted to identify and provide a code for every legal status which theoretically could underpin a child being ‘looked-after’. If future changes in legislation lead to new ‘looked-after’ legal statuses, we will provide new legal status codes. Our analysis of the use of the former legal status code 98 showed that in most cases such children were either not looked-after, or that another existing legal status was appropriate.
The ‘wardship’ legal status code was a possible legal status identified by some local authorities in the consultation exercise on the future of the SSDA903 codes for which we did not have an existing legal status. However, the use of this code was restricted to just a few exceptional cases where the High Court has exercised its residual power to make a child a ward of the High Court, and has directed that the child should be accommodated by a local authority. In practice such cases werefound to be so extremely rare, it was felt that the use of a separate code could not be warranted. If such a case should arise, it should be coded C2, as the practical effects are the same. "

The categories are designed only to identify what kind of pressures are placed on social services. They have no diagnostic value with regard to the children themselves and must not be used to determine what type of service the child should receive.
If there is difficulty choosing between two or more categories of need, choose the category that comes highest up in the table, for example, if trying to decide between family in acute stress and family dysfunction, choose family in acute stress.
The order of the categories relates to the specificity of the description and not necessarily importance. However, the order is fixed so that there is consistency.
Further information on choosing a primary need category is in appendix A.
The children in need census for 2005 and earlier tried to account for all money spent in a census week. To allow for this, ‘N9’ was created, but as this census is specifically child based, the definition of ‘N9’ from 2005 is not applicable. As in previous years, ‘N9’ can be used if a child is no longer in need and the only service they are receiving is adoption support (on an open case) immediately after they have been in need.
 Enter the primary need code, selecting from the table below:
-N1  Abuse or neglect
Children in need as a result of, or at risk of, abuse or neglect; also includes children at risk because of domestic violence.
-N2  Child’s disability
Children and families whose main need for services arises because of their child’s disability, illness or intrinsic condition.
-N3  Parental disability or illness
Children whose main need for services arises because the capacity of their parent(s) (or carer(s)) to care for them is impaired by the parent(s) (or carer(s)) disability, physical or mental illness, or addictions.
-N4  Family in acute stress
Children whose needs arise from living in a family that is going through a temporary crisis that diminishes the parental capacity to adequately meet some of the children’s needs.
-N5  Family dysfunction
Children whose needs primarily arise from living in a family where the parenting capacity is chronically inadequate.
-N6  Socially unacceptable behaviour
Children and families whose need for services primarily arise out of the child’s behaviour impacting detrimentally on the community.
-N7  Low income
Children, living in families or independently, whose needs primarily arise from being dependent on an income below the standard state entitlements.
-N8  Absent parenting
Children whose needs for services arise mainly from having no parents available to provide for them.
-N9  Cases other than children in need
Children who have been adopted and, although they are no longer a child in need, receive adoption support from children’s social services immediately after adoption. This should not be used where a child receives an adoption payment only as these children should not be included in the census.
The previous definition of ‘N9’ from 2005 was casework which is required for a legal and administrative reason only and there is no child in the case who is in need.
-N0  Not stated
Children whose reference data is not completely entered on the system and whose need code is yet to be determined, or the case is a referral that has been closed following assessment."

- RC9  Case closed after assessment, referred to early help.
If the case is still open then leave this item blank.
- ‘RC8 - case closed after assessment, no further action’ and ‘RC9 - case closed after assessment, referred to early help’.
The reason for closure code RC8 should be used by local authorities to categorise a case for a child who they assess following a referral, but for whom they do not provide services and whose case is subsequently closed. It should not be used for any other reason.
The reason for closure code RC9 should be used by local authorities to categorise a case for a child who they assess following a referral, but is subsequently referred to early help and whose case is then closed.
These are different from cases that were closed prior to assessment, at the referral stage; the referral no further action flag should be used in these cases (see section 4.3). The reason for closure codes RC8 and RC9 should not be used for cases that were closed prior to assessment, or for cases where services were provided following assessment.
In cases where the child has been assessed not to be in need after an assessment, the reason for closure code RC8 should be used. Where the child has been assessed not to be in need after an assessment and then referred to early help, the reason for closure code RC9 should be used. If a primary need code is retained on your system for these children, then this can be returned using the full code set listed in section 4.5. However, if you do not retain a primary need code for some or all of these children use code ‘N0’ for this field. This allows for children whose reference data is not completely entered on the system and whose need code is yet to be determined, or where the case is a referral that has been closed following assessment.
When the reason for closure code RC8 or RC9 is used the case should be closed on the same date as the assessment ends or, if this is not practical, as soon as possible afterwards. "

A children in need closure date can be the same as the referral date but, in practice, this should only very rarely occur. Closure date is not required for a referral that leads to no further action.
- Children in need closure in the case of adoption
When a child’s case is closed because of adoption (reason for closure code ‘RC1’), the children in need closure date will normally be the day when the court granted the adoption order.
It is recognised that an adoption case may sometimes remain open to allow all procedures to be completed. In this situation the census will allow for the case to extend up to one month after the date of the adoption order without having to open a new record. The need code would stay the same in these cases. Anything above one month will require a new record to be created. If a child remains in need after being adopted from care, then the new post-adoption child record should be opened with a children in need referral date that is the date of the court’s adoption order. If the child is receiving post-adoption support, it should be recorded in this new record.
- Children in need closure in the case of death
When a child is no longer in need because the child dies or an unborn child is stillborn (reason for closure code ‘RC2’), the closure date and the date of death recorded on the death certificate no longer need to match. It is recognised that the case may remain open for investigation and review procedures after the child dies; the date of death field allows local authorities to separately record the date of death and final case closure date in the census. This will allow local authorities to record the services they provide between the death and the case closure. "

Under the Children Act 1989, local authorities are required to provide services for children in need for the purposes of safeguarding and promoting their welfare. Local authorities undertake assessments of the needs of individual children to determine what services to provide and action to take.
Assessments should be recorded only at significant points such as the beginning of a new episode of need. It is not necessary to log new assessments at the point of closing an episode of need.
As set out in 'Working together to safeguard children' (2018), where the outcome of the assessment is continued through an agreed plan of action, the plan should be reviewed regularly, the outcomes of these reviews do not need to be recorded. However, if the situation changes significantly, this may result in the need for the completion of a new assessment, in which case this new assessment should be recorded.
Include all assessments that fall entirely or partly in the 2022 to 2023 collection year, including those that had started but had not finished by 31 March 2023, and those that started prior to 1 April 2022 and were completed within the 2022 to 2023 collection year. Please note, if a child is referred to a local authority and has been classified as in need following an assessment they should be included in the children in need census, regardless of whether they are receiving youth offending or any other service.
Within one working day of a referral being received, a decision should be made about the type of response required. The maximum timeframe from the assessment to arrive at a decision on the action to be taken should be no longer than 45 working days from the point of referral. This should be recorded as the end date of the assessment. Assessments may lead to no further action, the direct provision of services, and section 47 enquiries. See 'Working together to safeguard children' for further information.
There must always be an assessment actual start date, but if the assessment authorisation date falls after the end of the census year, it should be left blank. The assessment internal review point date is optional. "

• the impairment of the child’s health and development (‘Child’);
• the parent(s)/carer(s) capacity to respond to the child’s needs (‘Parenting capacity’);
• other people in the family/household, for example, a sibling or lodger (‘Other’).

This applies to all assessments completed.

The information should be recorded at the end of the assessment and all factors which are felt to be relevant to the child’s assessment should be reported from the list below. This includes factors where services are put in place to mitigate the effect of the factor as well as factors which need to be taken into account in providing other support.

Please only record factors which are currently an issue of concern. For example, if domestic violence is a current issue of concern, please record it. If domestic violence was an issue in a previous relationship and is not an issue of concern now, then do not record it. Factors such as mental health concerns do not need to be confined to medically defined conditions. Rather this is intended, for example, to record where the professional, as part of the assessment process, feels that mental health is of concern to the child’s health and development or parenting capacity to respond to the child’s needs.

Code 21 (no factors identified) should only be used for cases which are closed following assessments which result in no further action (closure code RC8 and RC9) and should be the only factor listed. However, if factors are identified for cases which are closed following assessment, please record these selecting from the list above, but excluding code 21.

If a section 47 enquiry has commenced on a case, then code 21 (no factors identified) should not be reported at the end of assessment even if it was found that the allegations that triggered the section 47 enquiry are unfounded. Instead, the relevant factors that were considered at the assessment that initiated the section 47 enquiry should be recorded. 
The case should then be closed using the reason for closure code: ‘RC7 - services ceased for any other reason, including child no longer in need’, as at the point the section 47 started the child would be counted as a child in need even if the case closed shortly after. 
Code 21 should only be used in cases where the section 47 enquiry was automatically triggered alongside the assessment and both the assessment and section 47 resulted in no further action.

More detailed descriptions and definitions of the factors are provided in the ‘Additional guide on the factors identified at the end of assessment’ for more information. The additional guide is available as part of the Children in need census: guide to submitting data.  Please report all the following factors that apply:
- 1A/1B/1C Alcohol misuse by the child/ parent(s) or carer(s)/ another person living in the household.

The latest category of abuse may be the same as the initial category of abuse. 
-NEG  Neglect
-PHY  Physical abuse
-SAB  Sexual abuse
-EMO  Emotional abuse
-MUL  Multiple/not recommended

The multiple category is for when more than one category of abuse is relevant to the child’s current protection plan. It is not intended to record information for children who have been the subject of more than one child protection plan during the year.
The category of abuse under which a child is made the subject of a child protection plan will have been decided upon at the child protection conference. However, if the category of abuse applicable to the current child protection plan has changed as a result of subsequent child protection conferences, then enter the latest category of abuse. Overall, the initial category of abuse is that decided upon at the conference; any amended category is to be recorded as the latest category of abuse.

The categories are defined for the purpose of this collection as follows:
-Neglect
Neglect is the persistent failure to meet a child’s basic physical and/or psychological needs, which is likely to result in the serious impairment of the child’s health or development. For instance, a parent or carer may fail to:
• provide adequate food, shelter, or clothing (including exclusion from home or abandonment);
• protect a child from physical harm, emotional harm, or danger;
• ensure adequate supervision (including the use of inadequate care-givers);
• ensure access to appropriate medical care or treatment.
It may also include neglect of, or unresponsiveness to, a child’s basic emotional needs.
More information on childhood neglect including training and resource materials can be found in Safeguarding children. -Physical abuse
Physical abuse may involve hitting, shaking, throwing, poisoning, burning or scalding, drowning, suffocating, or otherwise causing physical harm to a child. Physical harm may also be caused when a parent or carer deliberately fabricates symptoms or induces illness in a child. The fabrication and deliberate inducement or symptoms relate to conditions such as Munchausen syndrome by proxy.
-Sexual abuse
Sexual abuse involves forcing or enticing a child to take part in sexual activities, including prostitution, regardless of whether or not the child is aware of what is happening. Such activities may involve physical contact, including non-penetrative and penetrative acts (for example rape, buggery, or oral sex) or non-penetrative acts such as masturbation, kissing, rubbing and touching outside of clothing. They may also include non-contact activities, such as involving children in looking at, or in the production of, sexual images, watching sexual activities, encouraging children to behave in sexually inappropriate ways, or grooming a child in preparation for abuse (including via the internet). Sexual abuse is not solely perpetrated by adult males. Women can also commit acts of sexual abuse, as can other children.
-Emotional abuse
Emotional abuse is the persistent ill-treatment of a child that causes severe and continual adverse effects on the child’s emotional development. It may involve conveying to the child that they are inadequate, worthless or unloved, or valued only as far as they meet the needs of another person. It may include not giving the child opportunities to express their views, deliberately silencing them or making fun of what they say or how they communicate. It may feature the imposing of age or developmentally inappropriate expectations on the child. Such expectations may include interactions that are beyond the child’s developmental capability. It includes overprotection and limitation of exploration and learning, or preventing the child from participating in normal social interactions. It may involve the child seeing or hearing the ill-treatment of another. It may also involve serious bullying (including cyber bullying), causing children frequently to feel frightened or in danger, or the exploitation or corruption of children. Some level of emotional abuse is implied in all types of ill-treatment of a child, although it may occur on its own. Use this category when it is the main or sole form of abuse.
-Multiple/not recommended
This category is used to record multiple categories or where no category is recommended."

For the first episode in the year, this date can be in the current data year, or an earlier data year. When loading data using CSV or XML, dates must be recorded in a DD/MM/YYYY format. Example: 4 November 2023 should be entered as 04/11/2023.
Exceptionally, once loaded, the dates in the episode fields will appear as DD/MM/YY (year as a 2-digit number). Manual amendments to episode dates may be made using either format DD/MM/YY or DD/MM/YYYY, though the latter will appear as DD/MM/YY when saved). This is intended to make the episodes easier to read and manually amend, particularly when a record contains several episodes.
Where episodes are consecutive, the new episode must start on the same day that the previous episode finished.
When recording an agreement to provide a series of short-term placements (legal status V3/V4), enter in this field the date the first placement under the agreement began. For further information about children being looked-after under a series of short-term placements see Section 1.10.
Where an episode began in a previous statistical year, but is still open on 31 March, do not complete ‘Reason Episode Ceased’ or ‘Date Episode Ceased’. The following year’s record must then start with the same episode details showing the actual date the episode commenced if the episode subsequently closes, both the ‘Reason 
Episode Ceased’ and the ‘Date Episode Ceased’ should be recorded).
Episodes cannot start and end on the same day. If a child has two changes of legal status in one day only the second legal status is recorded. Similarly, in the unlikely event of two placements starting on the same day, only the status at the end of the day should be recorded. In such cases we no longer regard the first move of the day 
as being a placement. It follows from this that an essential component of a placement for SSDA903 purposes is that a placement must involve an overnight stay. A ‘placement’ that does not include an overnight stay should be regarded as a ‘visit’ and not shown on the SSDA903. "

Also use code S when recording agreements to provide short-term placements (legal status V4), and for individual breaks under such an agreement, if these are being recorded separately (legal status V3).
Use Code L where there is a change of legal status, but the placement does not change. By ‘legal status’ we mean the legal status underlying the fact that the child is looked-after.
Use Code P where there is a change of placement and carer, but the legal status does not change. This would include the following scenarios:
• Move from one foster carer to another foster carer (for example, U3 to another U3 placement type code).
• Move from a foster carer to a children’s home (for example, U3 to K2 placement types).
In both scenarios there has been a change of carer. When a child is living independently, a new episode should be created each time they move, and code P should be used.
Use Code T where there is a change of placement, but the child remains with the same carer and the legal status does not change. This would include the following scenarios:
• Child moves to a new house with current foster carer (either inside or outside of local authority boundary).
• Child remains with same carer or within same setting but either the URN of the setting changes or the provider type changes (for example, a foster carer moves from an IFA to the local authority provider, or a placement for adoption transferring to a regional adoption agency, or an unregulated independent or 
semi independent setting registering with Ofsted).
In both scenarios, the child has remained with the same carer, but for some other reason, a new placement is required on the SSDA903.
Use Code B where both legal status and placement change, with a change of carer, on the same day. The two changes do not need to be simultaneous or consequent one upon the other. The code simply reflects that there was a change in carer and a change in legal status, for whatever reason, on the same day.
Use Code U where both legal status and placement change on the same day, but the child remains with the same carer. The two changes do not need to be simultaneous or consequent one upon the other. The code simply reflects that there was a change in placement and a change in legal status, for whatever reason, on the same day. "

It should not be left blank. Only one reason can be recorded.
If a child is also looked after, the primary need code for children in need might not necessarily be the same as that recorded in the children looked after data collection. For example, this may occur if a child became looked after at a later date than when they became a child in need.
The categories are designed only to identify what kind of pressures are placed on social services. They have no diagnostic value with regard to the children themselves and must not be used to determine what type of service the child should receive.
If there is difficulty choosing between two or more categories of need, choose the category that comes highest up in the table, for example, if trying to decide between family in acute stress and family dysfunction, choose family in acute stress.
The order of the categories relates to the specificity of the description and not necessarily importance. However, the order is fixed so that there is consistency.
Further information on choosing a primary need category is in appendix A.
The children in need census for 2005 and earlier tried to account for all money spent in a census week. To allow for this, ‘N9’ was created, but as this census is specifically child based, the definition of ‘N9’ from 2005 is not applicable. As in previous years, ‘N9’ can be used if a child is no longer in need and the only service they are receiving is adoption support (on an open case) immediately after they have been in need.
 Enter the primary need code, selecting from the table below:
-N1  Abuse or neglect
Children in need as a result of, or at risk of, abuse or neglect; also includes children at risk because of domestic violence.
-N2  Child’s disability
Children and families whose main need for services arises because of their child’s disability, illness or intrinsic condition.
-N3  Parental disability or illness
Children whose main need for services arises because the capacity of their parent(s) (or carer(s)) to care for them is impaired by the parent(s) (or carer(s)) disability, physical or mental illness, or addictions.
-N4  Family in acute stress
Children whose needs arise from living in a family that is going through a temporary crisis that diminishes the parental capacity to adequately meet some of the children’s needs.
-N5  Family dysfunction
Children whose needs primarily arise from living in a family where the parenting capacity is chronically inadequate.
-N6  Socially unacceptable behaviour
Children and families whose need for services primarily arise out of the child’s behaviour impacting detrimentally on the community.
-N7  Low income
Children, living in families or independently, whose needs primarily arise from being dependent on an income below the standard state entitlements.
-N8  Absent parenting
Children whose needs for services arise mainly from having no parents available to provide for them.
-N9  Cases other than children in need
Children who have been adopted and, although they are no longer a child in need, receive adoption support from children’s social services immediately after adoption. This should not be used where a child receives an adoption payment only as these children should not be included in the census.
The previous definition of ‘N9’ from 2005 was casework which is required for a legal and administrative reason only and there is no child in the case who is in need.
-N0  Not stated

An episode cannot start and end on the same day. Where a child has not left care, a new episode must start on the same day as the previous episode finished.
When a child ceases to be looked-after because of adoption (reason episode ceased codes of E11 or E12), the date episode ceased is the date the court makes the adoption order.
When a child ceases to be looked-after because he/she dies whilst being looked-after (reason episode ceased code E2), the date episode ceased must be the same as the date of death as recorded on the death certificate.
Periods of care in local authority accommodation of less than 24 hours must not be recorded on the SSDA903. The only exceptions to this rule are:
• Children who are being regularly accommodated under an agreed series of short-term placements (legal status codes V3 and V4). Overnight stays of less than 24 hours may be treated as 24 hours for statistical purposes
• UASC. They should be recorded as a children looked after as soon as they come to the attention of local authorities, rather than only when they have been accommodated for 24 hours. Unlike other children, all UASC who come to the attention of local authorities will become looked-after so the 24-hour rule should not apply for this group of children. "

E5   Moved into independent living arrangement and no longer looked-after: supportive accommodation providing formalised advice/support arrangements (such as most hostels, young men’s Christian association, foyers, staying close and care leavers projects). Includes both children leaving care before and at age 18
E6   Moved into independent living arrangement and no longer looked-after: accommodation providing no formalised advice/support arrangements (such as bedsit, own flat, living with friend(s)). Includes both children leaving care before and at age 18
E7   Transferred to residential care funded by adult social care services
E9   Sentenced to custody
E14 Accommodation on remand ended
E15 Age assessment determined child is aged 18 or over and E5, E6 and E7 do not apply, such as an unaccompanied asylum-seeking child (UASC) whose age has been disputed
E16 Child moved abroad
E17 Aged 18 (or over) and remained with current carers (inc under staying put arrangements)
E8   Period of being looked-after ceased for any other reason (where none of the other reasons apply) Further detail on when some of the codes should be used is provided below:
E4A - Relates to a planned move where the child returns home as part of their agreed care plan. This return home has been discussed as part of the care planning process and happens within a planned timeframe.
E4B - Relates to an unplanned move - includes instances where the child’s return home is immediate (for example, within 24 hours) and has not been discussed as part of the care planning process or does not occur within the planned timeframe. This would include instances where a child under a voluntary arrangement is removed from care by their parents and this was not agreed as part of the care planning process.
E13 - Left care to live with parents, relatives, or other person with no parental responsibility – this code should be used if the child left care to live with parents, relatives or another person, but this person did not have parental responsibility.
E14 - Accommodation on remand ended – this code should be used if a child was remanded to youth detention accommodation and has stopped their episode of care because they are no longer remanded.
E15 - Age assessment determined child is aged 18 or over and E5, E6 and E7 do not apply, for example, an unaccompanied asylum seeking child whose age has been disputed – this code should be used if the episode of care ended because the age was disputed, an assessment revealed the child was 18 or over and the young person was not transferred to residential care and did not move into independent living arrangements. 
E16 - Moved abroad – use this code if the child left care because they moved to another country, including when a child is deported.
E17 - Aged 18 (or over) and remained with current carers (inc under staying put arrangements) – use this code whenever the young person has ceased care and remains with their former carers, irrespective of placement type. Young people in foster care who are ‘staying put’ are only a subset of this group.
E8 - Period of being looked-after ceased for any other reason – this code should never be used purely because a child has reached the age of 18 as this can already be deduced from his/her date of birth. It should only be used when none of the alternative destinations listed are appropriate. E8 should also be used when a child turns 18 and continues to be missing.
If a looked-after child is sentenced to custody and placed in a secure children’s home, secure training centre or young offenders’ institution, their status in that setting depends on the legislative framework under which the custodial sentence is applied. If the child is subject to a Care Order (Section 31 Children Act 1989) then they remain looked-after regardless of being sentenced to custody. If the child is accommodated in care by a voluntary agreement under Section 20 of the Children Act 1989, then they cease to be looked-after when they are admitted to custody."

Data items giving information on the provision of placements and the location where the child is being looked-after are collected in conjunction with the placement for each child. Please see paragraph 2.2.9 on placement provider and paragraph 2.2.6 on placement location in this guide for further details.
Some care is required when coding placement types, as there can be instances where a child remains living at the same location, but the placement code changes, and a new episode is required. There are also a few cases where a change of placement should not be recorded on the SSDA903, and those where the local authority has the option of whether to record them or not.
A change of placement can happen either when a child:
• Moves to a new placement, even if this does not require using a different placement code (this is the most frequent kind of placement change); or
• If the child remains at the same location, but the placement code changes for any other reason (for example, a child becomes ‘placed for adoption’ with foster parents).
In both instances the fact that it is a change of placement is indicated by the use of ‘Reason for New Episode’ codes P, B, T or U. Code set for placement type:
-A3   Placed for adoption with parental/guardian consent with current foster carer(s) (S19 Adoption and Children Act 2002) or with a freeing order where parental/guardian consent has been given (S18(1)(a) Adoption Act 1976)
-A4   Placed for adoption with parental/guardian consent not with current foster carer(s) (S19 Adoption and Children Act 2002) or with a freeing order where parental/guardian consent has been given (S18(1)(a) Adoption Act 1976)
-A5   Placed for adoption with placement order with current foster carer(s) (S21  Adoption and Children Act 2002) or with a freeing order where parental/guardian consent was dispensed with (S18(1)(b) Adoption Act 1976)
-A6   Placed for adoption with placement order not with current foster carer(s) (S21 Adoption and Children Act 2002) or with a freeing order where parental/guardian consent was dispensed with (S18(1)(b) of the Adoption Act 1976)

-K1   Secure children’s homes
-K2   Children’s Homes subject to Children’s Homes Regulations
-P1   Placed with own parent(s) or other person(s) with parental responsibility
-P2   Independent living e.g. in a flat/ lodgings, bedsit, B&B or with friends, with or without formal support

For children’s homes this would be the URN of the individual home and for foster or adoptive placements this would be the URN of the relevant service or agency providing the placement. For larger providers with multiple settings or branches the precise URN for the particular setting or branch is required.
The data, which will cover roughly 90% of all placements, will be used to map placement use in a more accurate way than previously possible to enable better understanding of placement patterns and to help improve understanding of why children are placed in certain placements and how this can impact on them. It will give a better understanding of the market for children’s homes and the use of independent fostering and adoption providers so that government can consider appropriate policy responses to help the sufficiency of the market. It is anticipated that local authorities will find the additional data helpful, for instance by linking Ofsted quality ratings to provision.
In some cases, it will be valid to provide different information to that registered with Ofsted, for example if a child is placed at the provider but at a different postcode to the main site. This could be the case if a child is residing in a dormitory with a different postcode to the registered site. Here the actual postcode where the child resides should be reported.
The URN is in the format SC999999 or 9999999 for newly registered providers. Note that secure training centres may have both a 6-digit education URN and a 7-digit social care URN and it is the 7-digit social care URN which should be returned in the SSDA903. Where local authorities are certain that a provider is not inspected by Ofsted but is inspected by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) or Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) then the code ‘XXXXXXX’ should be used. Similarly, the code ‘XXXXXXX’ should be used when the provider is a regional adoption agency.
It is possible there may be more than one URN for a provider, for instance if it was bought by another company and so re-registered, so it is important local authorities return the valid social care URN for the latest date the child was placed at the provider. If a provider has been de-registered, we expect the local authority to close the episode of care at that URN. Where the child remains with the same provider, but the URN has changed because of administrative changes, (for example, a change from the local authority’s children’s services to a children’s Trust that is registered with Ofsted), the local authority should add a new episode and use ‘T’ code for reason for new episode.
Please do not use the Ofsted website to obtain provider social care URNs. It is designed to allow the general public to find inspection reports across all Ofsted remits, rather than being a general search tool. There are legitimate numbers it won’t recognise and there are other inspected premises you will not be able to find (for example children’s homes when searching by address details); nor will it provide both social care and education URNs where a provider has both.
Ofsted are happy to advise and confirm the URN that should be provided in the CLA return if you have any queries. As a minimum, please provide them with the setting name, address and postcode. Their contact team email address is socialcaredata@ofsted.gov.uk and their contact team telephone number is 03000 130020.
Where placements are of a type or in a setting not inspected by Ofsted, such as placed with parents, then no URN is expected. "

This should be returned for all placements. Please see below for further details on the groups of children for whom this data item is not required, and additional fields that will be derived from the postcode fields.
Home and placement postcodes – further notes and definitions
Home and placement postcodes should be recorded for all placements during the latest year. There is one exception to this, children looked-after under an agreed series of short-term placements (legal status of V3 or V4). However, if a child changes to another legal status during the year (that is no longer an agreed series of short-term placements) then the postcodes should be entered for the new placement.
If the child is in a temporary placement use the postcode of the usual placement for the child, this should be the postcode of the placement that the child returns to following the temporary placement. If a child moves to a new placement after the temporary placements, then a placement move should be recorded in the usual way. The same should be applied for children who are missing from their placement.
For unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (UASC), the home postcode is not required but the placement postcode should be available. In this case, the placement postcode should be returned which will enable the derivation of ‘local authority of placement’ and ‘placement location’ fields (see below for further detail on these derived fields) but the home postcode should be left blank. Similarly, in other specific circumstances where a home postcode is not available, like for overseas children, the parents are homeless or a child from a traveller family, then the home postcode should be left blank.
The home and placement postcodes are then used to derive the following further data items for each placement:
• Distance between home and placement (miles). This is the calculated distance between the child’s home postcode and the child’s placement postcode. Local authorities can overwrite this manually where necessary.
• Local authority of placement. This is the local authority where the child is placed and gives the calculated local authority number. If the placement is not in England then the system will try to establish if the child is placed in Northern Ireland (NIR), Wales (WAL), Scotland (SCO), a confidential placement (CON) or outside the UK (NUK).
• Placement location. This is whether the child is looked after inside (IN) or outside (OUT) the local boundary responsible for the child’s care.
Distance between home and placement (miles) - (derived from postcodes)
To calculate the distance between home and placement, local authorities must include the home and placement postcodes.
When a child’s home postcode is outside of England or not available, or the placement postcode is not available, please use 999.9 for the distance. This includes children from overseas, children whose parents were homeless or children who had no fixed address as they belonged to a traveller family. "

The reason for placement change should be recorded against the episode that is ceasing, not against the new episode starting.

CARPL   Change to/Implementation of Care Plan
This code would be used where the change of placement is a planned part of the child’s care plan and will be a move to a placement that meets the child’s assessed needs on a temporary or permanent basis. This would include circumstances where a placement change was not expected but becomes necessary. The key factor is that planning takes place and the decision is recorded in the child’s care plan before the change takes place. This would include moves from short to long term foster care or where a child is placed for adoption with the current foster carer. It also includes movements to semi-independence. The nature of the change in plan will be monitored through the placement codes before and after this move. This should not include changes where the foster carer has moved to a new house or where the carer is the same but has changed provider type.
CLOSE   Resignation/ closure of provision
This code would be used where a child has to be moved because a foster carer decides to resign or the setting closes. This code would be used in a planned move; not in an emergency. The foster carer’s decision to resign may be because their circumstances have changed, for example, the foster carer becomes ill or another change of circumstances means that the foster carer is no longer able to provide a placement for the child. Circumstances may also include where the child’s placement had lasted longer than expected and the foster carer is no longer able to provide a placement for the child. Use of this code would also include where a setting (for example, a children’s home or a fostering service) closes and is therefore no longer a registered provision with Ofsted.
ALLEG   Allegation (s47)
This code would be used where a child has been removed from placement because of an allegation which is being investigated under s47 (Children Act 1989). This allegation may relate to the carer or another child at the setting. This code should not be used if the allegation has resulted in the setting’s approval (for example, a children’s home or a fostering service) being terminated – in this case, ‘approval removed’ should be used.
STAND   Standards of care concern
This code would be used where a child has been removed from placement by the responsible authority or provider as a result of concerns about standards of care. This does not mean a child protection investigation (s47) but a formal process followed by the provider. For example, see the National Minimum Standards for Fostering Service 2011, standard. 22. This code can be used for all types of placement such as foster care, residential care. This code should not be used if the setting’s approval is terminated as a result of standards of care concerns – in this case, ‘approval removed’ should be used.
CUSTOD   Custody arrangement
This code would be used where a child has been admitted into custody. APPRR   Approval removed
This code would be used where a setting is no longer approved/registered with the appropriate statutory body (such as Ofsted). This code can be used for all types of placement such as foster care, residential care. For example, this code should be used where a foster carer’s approval is terminated by the service following a s47 investigation, a standards of care issue, a complaint or for other reasons that relate to the carers’ conduct. It should also be used where Ofsted take enforcement action resulting in the closure of a residential setting. This code should not be used when a foster carer resigns or a provision is closed voluntarily and they are no longer registered with the relevant statutory body (such as Ofsted).
CREQB   Carer(s) requests placement end due to child’s behaviour
This code would be used where because of the child’s behaviour the placement has broken down or disrupted, and the carer has asked for the placement to end and the child to be moved to another placement. There may be some planning involved and a short period of time may pass but this is not a planned move.
CREQO   Carer(s) requests placement end other than due to child’s behaviour
These codes would be used where it was intended that the placement was a short or long term arrangement but has broken down or disrupted and the carer [foster carer, residential unit or connected person] has asked for the child to be moved to another placement. There may be some planning involved and a short period of time may pass but this is not a planned move.
CHILD   Child requests placement end
This code would be used where it was intended that the placement was a short- or long-term arrangement but has broken down or disrupted and the child has asked to move to another placement. There may be some planning involved and a short period of time may pass but this is not a planned move.
LAREQ   Responsible/area authority requests placement end
This code would be used where it was intended that the placement was a short- or long-term placement but the responsible authority has decided that the placement no longer meets the child’s needs. There may be some planning involved and a short period of time may pass but this is not a planned move. There will be circumstances where the child is at risk of harm and this would be coded as an allegation or standards of care concern. Where the placement no longer meets a child’s need but there is no immediate risk – this code would be used.
PLACE   Change in the status of placement only
This code would be used where there is a change of status for the placement, but the child remains with the same carer and there is no change to the care plan. Examples include a foster carer moving to a new house, a foster carer working for a local authority becomes managed by an independent fostering agency, a placement for adoption transferring to a regional adoption agency, or a child in residential accommodation moving under the same provider. Here the ‘reason for new episode’ code will indicate that the child is still living with the same carer.
OTHER   Other
Any other reason not captured above. Please note that ’Other’ should only be used in exceptional circumstances."

Information is collected for children who previously ceased to be looked-after due to the granting of an adoption order, a special guardianship order, residence order (until 22 April 2014) or a child arrangement order. The following should be included:
• children who start to be looked-after due to respite care arrangement

The information is required only once, the first time a child returns to care after the previous permanence order was granted, even if that was in a previous year. If the child subsequently leaves care (other than for adoption, SGO or RO) and returns gain, this information is not required for the subsequent return.

Carers continue to report that they find it difficult to access appropriate child and adolescent mental health services. The Government sees it as critical to address the issue of mental health of children looked-after to improve both their outcomes and life chances. This data item covers the emotional and behavioural health of children looked-after, as recorded by a main carer in the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ).
Statutory guidance on promoting the health and well-being of looked-after children issued under Section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970 sets out that all local authorities are required (paragraphs 14, 47 and Annex B) to make sure that a strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) is completed for each of their children looked after aged between 4-16 inclusive. As well as providing data at a national level on the emotional and behavioural health of children looked after, the SDQ also provides valuable information as part of a child’s annual health assessment. So it should not be seen purely as a data collection exercise. Its primary purpose is to give social workers and health professionals information about a child’s wellbeing.
While local authorities may use other screening/diagnostic tools in addition to the SDQ to monitor the emotional/mental health of their children looked after, nevertheless they must carry out the SDQ assessment in line with the above guidance. Unless a carer refuses to complete an SDQ a score should be returned for every child looked-after.
Data submitted
Local authorities will collect data through a standard strengths and difficulties questionnaire. 
A single score (0–40), or a reason for the score not being returned is required for each child looked-after continuously for at least 12 months aged 4–16 on the date of the last assessment. "

This module collects data on children who are missing from care or away from their placement without authorisation. All such episodes should be recorded, regardless of duration, along with the start/end date of the incident.

Additional Notes
If a missing from care or away from placement without authorisation episode starts and ends within the same day, then the same date should be returned for the start and end dates. Similarly, if more than one missing episode occurs within the same day, separate episodes should be recorded but these should have the same start/end dates.
If a child is away from placement without authorisation, but they subsequently become missing (meaning their whereabouts become unknown), this should be recorded as two separate episodes, but the end date of the away from placement without authorisation episode should be the same as the start date of the missing episode. This should be the point at which the child’s whereabouts became unknown. Equally, there may be some circumstances where the whereabouts of a missing child become known such that he/she is no longer considered to be missing, but the child is still not where they are supposed to be. A new ‘away from placement without authorisation’ episode should be recorded, and this would have a start date consistent with the date of the end of the missing episode. This should be the date the child’s whereabouts became known.
For children who start to be looked-after when missing, record the placement arranged for the child had the child not been missing, then add details of the missing child to the missing module.
If a child ceases to be looked-after whilst still missing (for example they turn 18) then please enter an end date for the missing/away from placement without authorisation which is equal to the date the child ceased to be looked-after. "

For young people aged 17 to 21 years, to be counted as ‘in touch’ for the purposes of this data item, there should be “contact” between your local authority and the young person around 3 months before and one month after the young person’s birthday..
For young people aged 22 to 25 to be counted as ‘in touch’ for the purposes of this data item, they should have contacted your local authority for support at some point during the year.
The OC3 data collection is designed to monitor the situation of young people when they have left care, rather than their situation immediately before they left care. Because the guidance says that the local authority should be in touch with the young person in the period three months before, to one month after the birthday, it is possible that the local authority will have been in touch with the young person while they were still in care.
If the birthday in question is the 17th birthday, then it should be recorded whether the local authority was in touch with the young person AFTER they had left care. Information should be returned if the young person left care before or on their 17th birthday, but not if they left care after their 17th birthday.
If the birthday in question is the 18th birthday, then we want to know whether your local authority is in touch with the person AFTER they left care and at some point up to 3 months after their 18th birthday. The accommodation and activity should reflect the most up to date information you have available up to the age of 18 years and 3 months. Information should be returned for young people who turned 18 in the year and left care before or on their 18th birthday.
If your local authority is in contact more than once during the relevant time period, the most up to date information on the last occasion of contact should be recorded for activity and accommodation.
Statutory guidance is clear that the Personal Adviser (PA) must have regular face to face contact with every care leaver they support. The pathway plan must set out expectations for the PA to see the care leaver and, if relevant, arrangements for staying in touch in other ways, which could include regular exchanges of text messages, emails and phone conversations between the PA and the young person. Further guidance on keeping in touch is given in chapter 4 of the Planning Transitions to Adulthood Guidance for Care Leavers.
For care leavers aged 17- to 21-years-old, if your local authority has contacted a young person, and the young person has responded by stating that they have no desire to supply your local authority with any information, and do not want to be contacted by your local authority again, this is should be coded as REFU - “young person refuses contact”. Similarly, if the young person has moved outside the local authority boundary and has chosen not to tell the local authority where they have gone, you still need to have been in communication with the young person to be able to count them as “in touch”.
Where a young person has previously been receiving Leaving Care Services but has now decided that they no longer require a service, this should be coded as NREQ – “young person no longer requires services”. NREQ should also be used for young people aged 22 years old and over who have not taken up the offer of Personal Adviser support.
Note, if the young person died (since leaving care) following their relevant birthday in the collection year, the information as at their last birthday should be provided including whether they were in touch or not at that point. If the young person died before their relevant birthday in the collection year, the code “DIED” should be used. If a young person died whilst in care, OC3 information is not required.
Children who have returned to live with parents or someone with parental responsibility for a period of more than 6 months are no longer ‘relevant children’ so the ‘in touch’ code used should be RHOM. However, if this arrangement then breaks down and the young person ceases to live with the person concerned, he/she once again becomes a ‘relevant child’ and ‘RHOM’ should not be used.

Code set for in touch:
- YES     Yes - in touch
- NO      No – not in touch
-DIED   Died after leaving care
-REFU   Young person refuses contact
-NREQ   Young person no longer requires children’s social care services
-RHOM  Young person returned to live with parents or someone with parental responsibility for a continuous period of 6 months or more

Contact through a third party is acceptable if you are satisfied that this represents a genuine exchange of information between the care leaver and your local authority. It is your responsibility to judge whether such contact is sufficient to qualify for definition as ‘in touch’. For example, if someone mentions that they have met the young person in passing and the young person appeared well, then this is not defined as ‘in touch’. However, if a third person passes a note from the young person to your local authority, then this would be classified as being ‘in touch’.
Contact through a third party who is working with the care leaver in a professional capacity is classified as ‘in touch’; for example, a young person’s advisor not directly employed by your local authority. It is expected that contact through a third person who works with care leavers in a professional capacity will be frequent. "

• The second digit is numerical, and indicates whether you judge the accommodation to be ‘suitable’ or ‘unsuitable’
• If you were not in touch with the young person and do not know their accommodation, or the young person has died, or returned home to live with parents or someone with parental responsibility for a continuous period of 6 months or more, (in touch code ‘RHOM’) enter 0 (zero).

Code set for type of accommodation
-B   With parent(s) or relative(s)
-C   Community home or other form of residential care such as an National Health Service (NHS) establishment

-V   Emergency accommodation (like a night shelter, direct access or emergency hostel)
-W   Bed and breakfast
-X   In custody
-Y   Other accommodation
-Z   With former foster carer(s) - where the young person has been fostered and on turning 18 continues to remain with the same carer(s) who had fostered them immediately prior to their reaching legal adulthood, and where the plan for their care involves their remaining with this former foster family for the future. This code should not be used for 17-year-old care leavers. If the foster carer is also a relative this code should be used rather than ‘B - with parents or relatives’. "

The following table provides a guide to the presumed responses for each of the accommodation types. However, there may be individual circumstances where these may not be the case. Accommodation is to be regarded as suitable if it provides safe, secure and affordable provision for young people. Accommodation that clearly exposes the person to risk of harm or social exclusion by reason of its location or other factors should be coded as ‘unsuitable’. "

If you were not in touch with the young person but are certain of their activity on their birthday, then please record this. Such examples might include where the young person was in a stable and ongoing activity such as posted abroad in the armed services, or where they have retrospectively confirmed that they had remained on an ongoing education course during the period. If you were not in touch with them and do not know their activity, or the young person has died or returned home to live with parents or someone with parental responsibility for a continuous period of 6 months or more (in touch code ‘RHOM’), enter 0 (zero).
If the young person is aged 22 to 25 years and has been in touch with your local authority at some point during the year, then please report their latest known activity.
Normally the young person should be asked what their main activity is. If their response is not clear and it is known that they are involved in more than one of the activity categories listed on the guidance notes, choose the one that is highest in the list. The list is ranked so that in general, if the young person is involved in both education and employment, education will be recorded as the main activity.
Code set for main activity:
-F1   Young person engaged full time in higher education (for example studies beyond A level)
-P1   Young person engaged part time in higher education (for example studies beyond A level)
-F2   Young person engaged full time in education other than higher education
-P2   Young person engaged part time in education other than higher education
-F4   Young person engaged full time in an apprenticeship
-P4   Young person engaged part time in an apprenticeship
-F5   Young person engaged full time in training or employment (not apprenticeship)
-P5   Young person engaged part time in training or employment (not apprenticeship)
-G4   Young person not in education, employment or training because of illness or disability
-G5   Young person not in education, employment or training: other circumstances
-G6   Young person not in education, employment or training due to pregnancy or parenting

Please note that if a young person in custody is engaged in a programme of education their activity should be recorded with an activity code that most accurately reflects this, for example part-time education. Before 2016 the guidance specified that a young person in custody should have an activity code of G5 (not in education, employment or training).
Full Time: The activity engages the young person for at least 16 hours a week.
Part Time: The activity engages the young person for less than 16 hours a week.
F1 and P1 - Young person engaged in higher education (meaning studies beyond A level): ‘Higher education’ means all studies at a higher academic level than A level. This includes degrees, diplomas in higher education, teaching and nursing qualifications, HNDs, ONDs, and BTEC levels 4-5. The educational course does not have to be residential.
F2 and P2 - Young person engaged in education other than higher education: This means all other education not covered by code F1 and P1. The educational course does not have to be residential.
F4 and P4 - Young person engaged in an apprenticeship: Includes apprenticeships only.
F5 and P5 - Young person engaged in training or employment: ‘Training’ includes government-supported training (other than Apprenticeships), such as Traineeships or Supported Internships. ‘Employment’ includes paid employment, self-employment, and voluntary unpaid work.
G4 - Young person not in education, employment or training, because of own illness or disability: Refers to young people where none of the above applies, specifically because the young person’s own illness or disability has prevented them from participating in any of these activities.
G5 - Young person not in education, employment or training (other circumstances) Refers to young people not covered by any of the other categories. However, this should not include young people who are not able to participate in any of these activities because of pregnancy or because they are parents or carers – these young people should be coded under G6.
G6 - Young person not in education, employment or training due to pregnancy or parenting: Refers to young people who are not able to participate in any of these activities because of pregnancy, or because they are parents or carers. "

Reason for social worker change: Notes and definitions
-MANAGE – Managing caseloads
Child transferred to a new social worker to balance social worker caseloads. This could be because the previous social worker’s caseload was too high, or the newly assigned social worker needed new cases.
This code should also be used where a social worker has been covering a social worker absence, but the child’s case does not return to the absent social worker on their return but another social worker. For example, an agency worker has been covering a maternity leave absence but the child’s case is then transferred to another social worker rather than the social worker returning from maternity leave.
This code should also be used in situations where a team leader has been holding a child’s case until a new primary social worker is allocated.
-FCONTA – First contact or re-referral
This code should be used for the first social worker assigned to the child within the local authority, or the first social worker assigned to the child following a re-referral to the local authority, where the child had previously left the care of the local authority. If a child’s case is initially held on a temporary basis for administrative purposes, for example, an ‘on duty team manager’ or a ‘referral worker’, before being assigned a social worker, then this should not be included. This initial process will be different for all local authorities, but as a general principle, please record the first social worker episode as the one in which the social worker will begin to have direct contact with the child.
-LEFTRL – Previous social worker left role
Use this code when the previous social worker left their current role, either to take up a new role in the local authority (including promotion or internal transfer), or left the local authority, and so a new social worker was assigned to the child.
-ORGRST – New social worker assigned following organisational restructure
Child transferred to a new social worker following an organisational restructure.
-TSPROC – New social worker assigned following child transfer due to standard process
Child transferred to a new social worker following a transfer to another service within the local authority, for example from an assessment team to a CIN team, or a move from the CIN team to the long-term CLA services.
ABSENC – Absence cover or return from absence
Previous social worker is on leave and a new social worker is assigned to formally 'hold' the child's case, e.g. previous social worker is on long term annual or sick leave, maternity, paternity, adoption or bereavement leave, sabbatical, or other absence.
This code should also be used when a social worker is reassigned a case following their return from an absence, during which another social worker was formally 'holding' the child's case. For example a social worker returns from maternity leave and is reassigned their previous cases.
If the primary social worker is temporarily absent (e.g. annual leave, etc.), this should not be recorded as a change in social worker episode unless they are no longer ‘holding’ the child’s case and a new primary social worker is formally ‘holding’ it.
CHCHAN – Child requested change from previous social worker
The relationship between the child and social worker has broken down or been disrupted and the child has asked to change to another social worker.
PCCHAN – Parent/carer requested change from previous social worker
The relationship between the child and/or parent or carer and the social worker has broken down or been disrupted and their parent or carer [foster carer, residential unit or connected person] has asked to change to another social worker.
SWDIED – Previous social worker died
Previous social worker died.
OTHERS – Other reason
Any other reason not captured above, including no reason found. To sign off your data, additional information will need to be added to your return to explain any reasons you report as other.
This code should also be used for the first social worker episode of the year if it was already open prior to the start of the collection period. For this specific reason, the child_id should be recorded in the additional information alongside the following wording: ‘Social worker episode already open prior to 1 April’. If a new social worker episode begins on the 1 April then this should be recorded separately with the relevant reason provided. "
