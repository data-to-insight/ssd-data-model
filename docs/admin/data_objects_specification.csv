Certain conditions are not regarded as impairments for the purposes of the act:
• addiction to, or dependency on, alcohol, nicotine, or any other substance (other than as a result of the substance being medically prescribed);
• the condition known as seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), except where it aggravates the effect of another condition;
• tendency to start fires;
• tendency to steal;
• tendency to physically or sexually abuse other persons;
• exhibitionism;
• voyeurism
In addition, disfigurements such as tattoos, non-medical body piercing, or something attached through such piercing, are not regarded as having a substantial adverse effect on the person’s ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.
If a child is disabled or becomes disabled at any time during the collection year, record all the relevant disabilities that have affected the child. For example, children may have multiple disabilities in which case more than one category from the below list can be selected. ‘Other DDA’ can also be used in conjunction with any of the other categories.
If your MIS does not allow for the identification of individual disabilities, then the code ‘Other DDA’ may be used for all children with a disability. However, this must be recorded in your COLLECT return level notes so your data can be analysed appropriately.

If a child is looked-after because it is accommodated, the legal status goes some way to describe (in legal terms at least) why the child is being looked after. There are many legal statuses arising from the Children Act, or the Youth Justice System, to which a child can be subject, but which have no bearing on whether a child is ‘looked-after’ or not. These are not recorded on the SSDA903, and no legal status codes are provided for them.
The renewal of an existing legal status does not automatically generate a new episode. If the legal status code does not change, a new episode is not required (unless there happens to be a change of placement at the same time).
Example: If a child is already looked-after under an interim care order, a renewal of the interim care order does not change the legal status and no new episode is required. However, if a child looked-after under an interim care order becomes the subject of a full care order, then a new episode is required to record the start of the full care order.
In certain circumstances a child being looked-after can have more than one ‘lookedafter’ legal status. In general, this happens when a child who is already ‘looked-after’ under a Children Act care order comes into contact with the Youth Justice System, and as a result is detained in local authority accommodation under a second legal status. Two legal statuses cannot be shown as current on SSDA903. In such cases the latest legal status should be recorded and the episode under the previous status should be closed
Example: A child who is already subject to a care order is remanded to local authority accommodation under Section 23 (1) of CYPA 1969. The care order episode should be closed, and a new episode should start under the “remanded to local authority accommodation” legal status code. When the episode under the remand status ends, a further episode under the care order legal status will start, unless the care order has been discharged.
We have attempted to identify and provide a code for every legal status which theoretically could underpin a child being ‘looked-after’. If future changes in legislation lead to new ‘looked-after’ legal statuses, we will provide new legal status codes. Our analysis of the use of the former legal status code 98 showed that in most cases such children were either not looked-after, or that another existing legal status was appropriate.
The ‘wardship’ legal status code was a possible legal status identified by some local authorities in the consultation exercise on the future of the SSDA903 codes for which we did not have an existing legal status. However, the use of this code was restricted to just a few exceptional cases where the High Court has exercised its residual power to make a child a ward of the High Court, and has directed that the child should be accommodated by a local authority. In practice such cases werefound to be so extremely rare, it was felt that the use of a separate code could not be warranted. If such a case should arise, it should be coded C2, as the practical effects are the same.",

If there is difficulty choosing between two or more categories of need, choose the category that comes highest up in the table, for example, if trying to decide between family in acute stress and family dysfunction, choose family in acute stress.
The order of the categories relates to the specificity of the description and not necessarily importance. However, the order is fixed so that there is consistency.
Further information on choosing a primary need category is in appendix A.
The children in need census for 2005 and earlier tried to account for all money spent in a census week. To allow for this, ‘N9’ was created, but as this census is specifically child based, the definition of ‘N9’ from 2005 is not applicable. As in previous years, ‘N9’ can be used if a child is no longer in need and the only service they are receiving is adoption support (on an open case) immediately after they have been in need.

If the case is still open then leave this item blank.
- ‘RC8 - case closed after assessment, no further action’ and ‘RC9 - case closed after assessment, referred to early help’.
The reason for closure code RC8 should be used by local authorities to categorise a case for a child who they assess following a referral, but for whom they do not provide services and whose case is subsequently closed. It should not be used for any other reason.
The reason for closure code RC9 should be used by local authorities to categorise a case for a child who they assess following a referral, but is subsequently referred to early help and whose case is then closed.
These are different from cases that were closed prior to assessment, at the referral stage; the referral no further action flag should be used in these cases (see section 4.3). The reason for closure codes RC8 and RC9 should not be used for cases that were closed prior to assessment, or for cases where services were provided following assessment.
In cases where the child has been assessed not to be in need after an assessment, the reason for closure code RC8 should be used. Where the child has been assessed not to be in need after an assessment and then referred to early help, the reason for closure code RC9 should be used. If a primary need code is retained on your system for these children, then this can be returned using the full code set listed in section 4.5. However, if you do not retain a primary need code for some or all of these children use code ‘N0’ for this field. This allows for children whose reference data is not completely entered on the system and whose need code is yet to be determined, or where the case is a referral that has been closed following assessment.
When the reason for closure code RC8 or RC9 is used the case should be closed on the same date as the assessment ends or, if this is not practical, as soon as possible afterwards.",

A children in need closure date can be the same as the referral date but, in practice, this should only very rarely occur. Closure date is not required for a referral that leads to no further action.
- Children in need closure in the case of adoption
When a child’s case is closed because of adoption (reason for closure code ‘RC1’), the children in need closure date will normally be the day when the court granted the adoption order.
It is recognised that an adoption case may sometimes remain open to allow all procedures to be completed. In this situation the census will allow for the case to extend up to one month after the date of the adoption order without having to open a new record. The need code would stay the same in these cases. Anything above one month will require a new record to be created. If a child remains in need after being adopted from care, then the new post-adoption child record should be opened with a children in need referral date that is the date of the court’s adoption order. If the child is receiving post-adoption support, it should be recorded in this new record.
- Children in need closure in the case of death
When a child is no longer in need because the child dies or an unborn child is stillborn (reason for closure code ‘RC2’), the closure date and the date of death recorded on the death certificate no longer need to match. It is recognised that the case may remain open for investigation and review procedures after the child dies; the date of death field allows local authorities to separately record the date of death and final case closure date in the census. This will allow local authorities to record the services they provide between the death and the case closure.",

Under the Children Act 1989, local authorities are required to provide services for children in need for the purposes of safeguarding and promoting their welfare. Local authorities undertake assessments of the needs of individual children to determine what services to provide and action to take.
Assessments should be recorded only at significant points such as the beginning of a new episode of need. It is not necessary to log new assessments at the point of closing an episode of need.
As set out in 'Working together to safeguard children' (2018), where the outcome of the assessment is continued through an agreed plan of action, the plan should be reviewed regularly, the outcomes of these reviews do not need to be recorded. However, if the situation changes significantly, this may result in the need for the completion of a new assessment, in which case this new assessment should be recorded.
Include all assessments that fall entirely or partly in the 2022 to 2023 collection year, including those that had started but had not finished by 31 March 2023, and those that started prior to 1 April 2022 and were completed within the 2022 to 2023 collection year. Please note, if a child is referred to a local authority and has been classified as in need following an assessment they should be included in the children in need census, regardless of whether they are receiving youth offending or any other service.
Within one working day of a referral being received, a decision should be made about the type of response required. The maximum timeframe from the assessment to arrive at a decision on the action to be taken should be no longer than 45 working days from the point of referral. This should be recorded as the end date of the assessment. Assessments may lead to no further action, the direct provision of services, and section 47 enquiries. See 'Working together to safeguard children' for further information.
There must always be an assessment actual start date, but if the assessment authorisation date falls after the end of the census year, it should be left blank. The assessment internal review point date is optional.",

• the impairment of the child’s health and development (‘Child’);
• the parent(s)/carer(s) capacity to respond to the child’s needs (‘Parenting capacity’);
• other people in the family/household, for example, a sibling or lodger (‘Other’).

This applies to all assessments completed.

The information should be recorded at the end of the assessment and all factors which are felt to be relevant to the child’s assessment should be reported from the list below. This includes factors where services are put in place to mitigate the effect of the factor as well as factors which need to be taken into account in providing other support.

Please only record factors which are currently an issue of concern. For example, if domestic violence is a current issue of concern, please record it. If domestic violence was an issue in a previous relationship and is not an issue of concern now, then do not record it. Factors such as mental health concerns do not need to be confined to medically defined conditions. Rather this is intended, for example, to record where the professional, as part of the assessment process, feels that mental health is of concern to the child’s health and development or parenting capacity to respond to the child’s needs.

Code 21 (no factors identified) should only be used for cases which are closed following assessments which result in no further action (closure code RC8 and RC9) and should be the only factor listed. However, if factors are identified for cases which are closed following assessment, please record these selecting from the list above, but excluding code 21.

If a section 47 enquiry has commenced on a case, then code 21 (no factors identified) should not be reported at the end of assessment even if it was found that the allegations that triggered the section 47 enquiry are unfounded. Instead, the relevant factors that were considered at the assessment that initiated the section 47 enquiry should be recorded. 
The case should then be closed using the reason for closure code: ‘RC7 - services ceased for any other reason, including child no longer in need’, as at the point the section 47 started the child would be counted as a child in need even if the case closed shortly after. 
Code 21 should only be used in cases where the section 47 enquiry was automatically triggered alongside the assessment and both the assessment and section 47 resulted in no further action.

More detailed descriptions and definitions of the factors are provided in the ‘Additional guide on the factors identified at the end of assessment’ for more information. The additional guide is available as part of the Children in need census: guide to submitting data. ",

The latest category of abuse may be the same as the initial category of abuse. 
-NEG  Neglect
-PHY  Physical abuse
-SAB  Sexual abuse
-EMO  Emotional abuse
-MUL  Multiple/not recommended

The multiple category is for when more than one category of abuse is relevant to the child’s current protection plan. It is not intended to record information for children who have been the subject of more than one child protection plan during the year.
The category of abuse under which a child is made the subject of a child protection plan will have been decided upon at the child protection conference. However, if the category of abuse applicable to the current child protection plan has changed as a result of subsequent child protection conferences, then enter the latest category of abuse. Overall, the initial category of abuse is that decided upon at the conference; any amended category is to be recorded as the latest category of abuse.

The categories are defined for the purpose of this collection as follows:
-Neglect
Neglect is the persistent failure to meet a child’s basic physical and/or psychological needs, which is likely to result in the serious impairment of the child’s health or development. For instance, a parent or carer may fail to:
• provide adequate food, shelter, or clothing (including exclusion from home or abandonment);
• protect a child from physical harm, emotional harm, or danger;
• ensure adequate supervision (including the use of inadequate care-givers);
• ensure access to appropriate medical care or treatment.
It may also include neglect of, or unresponsiveness to, a child’s basic emotional needs.
More information on childhood neglect including training and resource materials can be found in Safeguarding children.",

For the first episode in the year, this date can be in the current data year, or an earlier data year. When loading data using CSV or XML, dates must be recorded in a DD/MM/YYYY format. Example: 4 November 2023 should be entered as 04/11/2023.
Exceptionally, once loaded, the dates in the episode fields will appear as DD/MM/YY (year as a 2-digit number). Manual amendments to episode dates may be made using either format DD/MM/YY or DD/MM/YYYY, though the latter will appear as DD/MM/YY when saved). This is intended to make the episodes easier to read and manually amend, particularly when a record contains several episodes.
Where episodes are consecutive, the new episode must start on the same day that the previous episode finished.
When recording an agreement to provide a series of short-term placements (legal status V3/V4), enter in this field the date the first placement under the agreement began. For further information about children being looked-after under a series of short-term placements see Section 1.10.
Where an episode began in a previous statistical year, but is still open on 31 March, do not complete ‘Reason Episode Ceased’ or ‘Date Episode Ceased’. The following year’s record must then start with the same episode details showing the actual date the episode commenced if the episode subsequently closes, both the ‘Reason 
Episode Ceased’ and the ‘Date Episode Ceased’ should be recorded).
Episodes cannot start and end on the same day. If a child has two changes of legal status in one day only the second legal status is recorded. Similarly, in the unlikely event of two placements starting on the same day, only the status at the end of the day should be recorded. In such cases we no longer regard the first move of the day 
as being a placement. It follows from this that an essential component of a placement for SSDA903 purposes is that a placement must involve an overnight stay. A ‘placement’ that does not include an overnight stay should be regarded as a ‘visit’ and not shown on the SSDA903.",

Also use code S when recording agreements to provide short-term placements (legal status V4), and for individual breaks under such an agreement, if these are being recorded separately (legal status V3).
Use Code L where there is a change of legal status, but the placement does not change. By ‘legal status’ we mean the legal status underlying the fact that the child is looked-after.
Use Code P where there is a change of placement and carer, but the legal status does not change. This would include the following scenarios:
• Move from one foster carer to another foster carer (for example, U3 to another U3 placement type code).
• Move from a foster carer to a children’s home (for example, U3 to K2 placement types).
In both scenarios there has been a change of carer. When a child is living independently, a new episode should be created each time they move, and code P should be used.
Use Code T where there is a change of placement, but the child remains with the same carer and the legal status does not change. This would include the following scenarios:
• Child moves to a new house with current foster carer (either inside or outside of local authority boundary).
• Child remains with same carer or within same setting but either the URN of the setting changes or the provider type changes (for example, a foster carer moves from an IFA to the local authority provider, or a placement for adoption transferring to a regional adoption agency, or an unregulated independent or 
semi independent setting registering with Ofsted).
In both scenarios, the child has remained with the same carer, but for some other reason, a new placement is required on the SSDA903.
Use Code B where both legal status and placement change, with a change of carer, on the same day. The two changes do not need to be simultaneous or consequent one upon the other. The code simply reflects that there was a change in carer and a change in legal status, for whatever reason, on the same day.
Use Code U where both legal status and placement change on the same day, but the child remains with the same carer. The two changes do not need to be simultaneous or consequent one upon the other.

• UASC. They should be recorded as a children looked after as soon as they come to the attention of local authorities, rather than only when they have been accommodated for 24 hours.

Data items giving information on the provision of placements and the location where the child is being looked-after are collected in conjunction with the placement for each child. Please see paragraph 2.2.9 on placement provider and paragraph 2.2.6 on placement location in this guide for further details.
Some care is required when coding placement types, as there can be instances where a child remains living at the same location, but the placement code changes, and a new episode is required. There are also a few cases where a change of placement should not be recorded on the SSDA903, and those where the local authority has the option of whether to record them or not.
A change of placement can happen either when a child:
• Moves to a new placement, even if this does not require using a different placement code (this is the most frequent kind of placement change); or
• If the child remains at the same location, but the placement code changes for any other reason (for example, a child becomes ‘placed for adoption’ with foster parents).

For children’s homes this would be the URN of the individual home and for foster or adoptive placements this would be the URN of the relevant service or agency providing the placement. For larger providers with multiple settings or branches the precise URN for the particular setting or branch is required.
The data, which will cover roughly 90% of all placements, will be used to map placement use in a more accurate way than previously possible to enable better understanding of placement patterns and to help improve understanding of why children are placed in certain placements and how this can impact on them. It will give a better understanding of the market for children’s homes and the use of independent fostering and adoption providers so that government can consider appropriate policy responses to help the sufficiency of the market. It is anticipated that local authorities will find the additional data helpful, for instance by linking Ofsted quality ratings to provision.
In some cases, it will be valid to provide different information to that registered with Ofsted, for example if a child is placed at the provider but at a different postcode to the main site. This could be the case if a child is residing in a dormitory with a different postcode to the registered site. Here the actual postcode where the child resides should be reported.
The URN is in the format SC999999 or 9999999 for newly registered providers. Note that secure training centres may have both a 6-digit education URN and a 7-digit social care URN and it is the 7-digit social care URN which should be returned in the SSDA903. Where local authorities are certain that a provider is not inspected by Ofsted but is inspected by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) or Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) then the code ‘XXXXXXX’ should be used. Similarly, the code ‘XXXXXXX’ should be used when the provider is a regional adoption agency.
It is possible there may be more than one URN for a provider, for instance if it was bought by another company and so re-registered, so it is important local authorities return the valid social care URN for the latest date the child was placed at the provider. If a provider has been de-registered, we expect the local authority to close the episode of care at that URN. Where the child remains with the same provider, but the URN has changed because of administrative changes, (for example, a change from the local authority’s children’s services to a children’s Trust that is registered with Ofsted), the local authority should add a new episode and use ‘T’ code for reason for new episode.
Please do not use the Ofsted website to obtain provider social care URNs. It is designed to allow the general public to find inspection reports across all Ofsted remits, rather than being a general search tool. There are legitimate numbers it won’t recognise and there are other inspected premises you will not be able to find (for example children’s homes when searching by address details); nor will it provide both social care and education URNs where a provider has both.
Ofsted are happy to advise and confirm the URN that should be provided in the CLA return if you have any queries. As a minimum, please provide them with the setting name, address and postcode. Their contact team email address is socialcaredata@ofsted.gov.uk and their contact team telephone number is 03000 130020.
Where placements are of a type or in a setting not inspected by Ofsted, such as placed with parents, then no URN is expected.",

This should be returned for all placements. Please see below for further details on the groups of children for whom this data item is not required, and additional fields that will be derived from the postcode fields.
Home and placement postcodes – further notes and definitions
Home and placement postcodes should be recorded for all placements during the latest year. There is one exception to this, children looked-after under an agreed series of short-term placements (legal status of V3 or V4). However, if a child changes to another legal status during the year (that is no longer an agreed series of short-term placements) then the postcodes should be entered for the new placement.
If the child is in a temporary placement use the postcode of the usual placement for the child, this should be the postcode of the placement that the child returns to following the temporary placement. If a child moves to a new placement after the temporary placements, then a placement move should be recorded in the usual way. The same should be applied for children who are missing from their placement.
For unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (UASC), the home postcode is not required but the placement postcode should be available. In this case, the placement postcode should be returned which will enable the derivation of ‘local authority of placement’ and ‘placement location’ fields (see below for further detail on these derived fields) but the home postcode should be left blank. Similarly, in other specific circumstances where a home postcode is not available, like for overseas children, the parents are homeless or a child from a traveller family, then the home postcode should be left blank.
The home and placement postcodes are then used to derive the following further data items for each placement:
• Distance between home and placement (miles). This is the calculated distance between the child’s home postcode and the child’s placement postcode. Local authorities can overwrite this manually where necessary.
• Local authority of placement. This is the local authority where the child is placed and gives the calculated local authority number. If the placement is not in England then the system will try to establish if the child is placed in Northern Ireland (NIR), Wales (WAL), Scotland (SCO), a confidential placement (CON) or outside the UK (NUK).
• Placement location. This is whether the child is looked after inside (IN) or outside (OUT) the local boundary responsible for the child’s care.
Distance between home and placement (miles) - (derived from postcodes)
To calculate the distance between home and placement, local authorities must include the home and placement postcodes.
When a child’s home postcode is outside of England or not available, or the placement postcode is not available, please use 999.9 for the distance. This includes children from overseas, children whose parents were homeless or children who had no fixed address as they belonged to a traveller family.",

The reason for placement change should be recorded against the episode that is ceasing, not against the new episode starting.

CARPL   Change to/Implementation of Care Plan
This code would be used where the change of placement is a planned part of the child’s care plan and will be a move to a placement that meets the child’s assessed needs on a temporary or permanent basis. This would include circumstances where a placement change was not expected but becomes necessary. The key factor is that planning takes place and the decision is recorded in the child’s care plan before the change takes place. This would include moves from short to long term foster care or where a child is placed for adoption with the current foster carer. It also includes movements to semi-independence. The nature of the change in plan will be monitored through the placement codes before and after this move. This should not include changes where the foster carer has moved to a new house or where the carer is the same but has changed provider type.
CLOSE   Resignation/ closure of provision
This code would be used where a child has to be moved because a foster carer decides to resign or the setting closes. This code would be used in a planned move; not in an emergency. The foster carer’s decision to resign may be because their circumstances have changed, for example, the foster carer becomes ill or another change of circumstances means that the foster carer is no longer able to provide a placement for the child. Circumstances may also include where the child’s placement had lasted longer than expected and the foster carer is no longer able to provide a placement for the child. Use of this code would also include where a setting (for example, a children’s home or a fostering service) closes and is therefore no longer a registered provision with Ofsted.
ALLEG   Allegation (s47)
This code would be used where a child has been removed from placement because of an allegation which is being investigated under s47 (Children Act 1989). This allegation may relate to the carer or another child at the setting. This code should not be used if the allegation has resulted in the setting’s approval (for example, a children’s home or a fostering service) being terminated – in this case, ‘approval removed’ should be used.
STAND   Standards of care concern
This code would be used where a child has been removed from placement by the responsible authority or provider as a result of concerns about standards of care. This does not mean a child protection investigation (s47) but a formal process followed by the provider. For example, see the National Minimum Standards for Fostering Service 2011, standard. 22. This code can be used for all types of placement such as foster care, residential care. This code should not be used if the setting’s approval is terminated as a result of standards of care concerns – in this case, ‘approval removed’ should be used.
CUSTOD   Custody arrangement
This code would be used where a child has been admitted into custody.",

Carers continue to report that they find it difficult to access appropriate child and adolescent mental health services. The Government sees it as critical to address the issue of mental health of children looked-after to improve both their outcomes and life chances. This data item covers the emotional and behavioural health of children looked-after, as recorded by a main carer in the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ).
Statutory guidance on promoting the health and well-being of looked-after children issued under Section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970 sets out that all local authorities are required (paragraphs 14, 47 and Annex B) to make sure that a strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) is completed for each of their children looked after aged between 4-16 inclusive. As well as providing data at a national level on the emotional and behavioural health of children looked after, the SDQ also provides valuable information as part of a child’s annual health assessment. So it should not be seen purely as a data collection exercise. Its primary purpose is to give social workers and health professionals information about a child’s wellbeing.
While local authorities may use other screening/diagnostic tools in addition to the SDQ to monitor the emotional/mental health of their children looked after, nevertheless they must carry out the SDQ assessment in line with the above guidance. Unless a carer refuses to complete an SDQ a score should be returned for every child looked-after.
Data submitted
Local authorities will collect data through a standard strengths and difficulties questionnaire. 
A single score (0–40), or a reason for the score not being returned is required for each child looked-after continuously for at least 12 months aged 4–16 on the date of the last assessment.",

This module collects data on children who are missing from care or away from their placement without authorisation. All such episodes should be recorded, regardless of duration, along with the start/end date of the incident.

Additional Notes
If a missing from care or away from placement without authorisation episode starts and ends within the same day, then the same date should be returned for the start and end dates. Similarly, if more than one missing episode occurs within the same day, separate episodes should be recorded but these should have the same start/end dates.
If a child is away from placement without authorisation, but they subsequently become missing (meaning their whereabouts become unknown), this should be recorded as two separate episodes, but the end date of the away from placement without authorisation episode should be the same as the start date of the missing episode. This should be the point at which the child’s whereabouts became unknown. Equally, there may be some circumstances where the whereabouts of a missing child become known such that he/she is no longer considered to be missing, but the child is still not where they are supposed to be. A new ‘away from placement without authorisation’ episode should be recorded, and this would have a start date consistent with the date of the end of the missing episode. This should be the date the child’s whereabouts became known.
For children who start to be looked-after when missing, record the placement arranged for the child had the child not been missing, then add details of the missing child to the missing module.
If a child ceases to be looked-after whilst still missing (for example they turn 18) then please enter an end date for the missing/away from placement without authorisation which is equal to the date the child ceased to be looked-after.",
