Certain conditions are not regarded as impairments for the purposes of the act:
• addiction to, or dependency on, alcohol, nicotine, or any other substance (other than as a result of the substance being medically prescribed);
• the condition known as seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), except where it aggravates the effect of another condition;
• tendency to start fires;
• tendency to steal;
• tendency to physically or sexually abuse other persons;
• exhibitionism;
• voyeurism
In addition, disfigurements such as tattoos, non-medical body piercing, or something attached through such piercing, are not regarded as having a substantial adverse effect on the person’s ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.
If a child is disabled or becomes disabled at any time during the collection year, record all the relevant disabilities that have affected the child. For example, children may have multiple disabilities in which case more than one category from the below list can be selected. ‘Other DDA’ can also be used in conjunction with any of the other categories.
If your MIS does not allow for the identification of individual disabilities, then the code ‘Other DDA’ may be used for all children with a disability. However, this must be recorded in your COLLECT return level notes so your data can be analysed appropriately.
If a child has no disability, do not leave this item blank; use the code ‘NONE’. However, if a child is unborn then the disability item should be left blank."

If a child is looked-after because it is accommodated, the legal status goes some way to describe (in legal terms at least) why the child is being looked after. There are many legal statuses arising from the Children Act, or the Youth Justice System, to which a child can be subject, but which have no bearing on whether a child is ‘looked-after’ or not. These are not recorded on the SSDA903, and no legal status codes are provided for them.
The renewal of an existing legal status does not automatically generate a new episode. If the legal status code does not change, a new episode is not required (unless there happens to be a change of placement at the same time).
Example: If a child is already looked-after under an interim care order, a renewal of the interim care order does not change the legal status and no new episode is required. However, if a child looked-after under an interim care order becomes the subject of a full care order, then a new episode is required to record the start of the full care order.
In certain circumstances a child being looked-after can have more than one ‘lookedafter’ legal status. In general, this happens when a child who is already ‘looked-after’ under a Children Act care order comes into contact with the Youth Justice System, and as a result is detained in local authority accommodation under a second legal status. Two legal statuses cannot be shown as current on SSDA903. In such cases the latest legal status should be recorded and the episode under the previous status should be closed
Example: A child who is already subject to a care order is remanded to local authority accommodation under Section 23 (1) of CYPA 1969. The care order episode should be closed, and a new episode should start under the “remanded to local authority accommodation” legal status code. When the episode under the remand status ends, a further episode under the care order legal status will start, unless the care order has been discharged.
We have attempted to identify and provide a code for every legal status which theoretically could underpin a child being ‘looked-after’. If future changes in legislation lead to new ‘looked-after’ legal statuses, we will provide new legal status codes. Our analysis of the use of the former legal status code 98 showed that in most cases such children were either not looked-after, or that another existing legal status was appropriate.
The ‘wardship’ legal status code was a possible legal status identified by some local authorities in the consultation exercise on the future of the SSDA903 codes for which we did not have an existing legal status. However, the use of this code was restricted to just a few exceptional cases where the High Court has exercised its residual power to make a child a ward of the High Court, and has directed that the child should be accommodated by a local authority. In practice such cases werefound to be so extremely rare, it was felt that the use of a separate code could not be warranted. If such a case should arise, it should be coded C2, as the practical effects are the same."

The reason for closure code RC8 should be used by local authorities to categorise a case for a child who they assess following a referral, but for whom they do not provide services and whose case is subsequently closed. It should not be used for any other reason.
The reason for closure code RC9 should be used by local authorities to categorise a case for a child who they assess following a referral, but is subsequently referred to early help and whose case is then closed.
These are different from cases that were closed prior to assessment, at the referral stage; the referral no further action flag should be used in these cases (see section 4.3). The reason for closure codes RC8 and RC9 should not be used for cases that were closed prior to assessment, or for cases where services were provided following assessment.
In cases where the child has been assessed not to be in need after an assessment, the reason for closure code RC8 should be used. Where the child has been assessed not to be in need after an assessment and then referred to early help, the reason for closure code RC9 should be used. If a primary need code is retained on your system for these children, then this can be returned using the full code set listed in section 4.5. However, if you do not retain a primary need code for some or all of these children use code ‘N0’ for this field. This allows for children whose reference data is not completely entered on the system and whose need code is yet to be determined, or where the case is a referral that has been closed following assessment.
When the reason for closure code RC8 or RC9 is used the case should be closed on the same date as the assessment ends or, if this is not practical, as soon as possible afterwards."

A children in need closure date can be the same as the referral date but, in practice, this should only very rarely occur. Closure date is not required for a referral that leads to no further action.
- Children in need closure in the case of adoption
When a child’s case is closed because of adoption (reason for closure code ‘RC1’), the children in need closure date will normally be the day when the court granted the adoption order.
It is recognised that an adoption case may sometimes remain open to allow all procedures to be completed. In this situation the census will allow for the case to extend up to one month after the date of the adoption order without having to open a new record. The need code would stay the same in these cases. Anything above one month will require a new record to be created. If a child remains in need after being adopted from care, then the new post-adoption child record should be opened with a children in need referral date that is the date of the court’s adoption order. If the child is receiving post-adoption support, it should be recorded in this new record.
- Children in need closure in the case of death
When a child is no longer in need because the child dies or an unborn child is stillborn (reason for closure code ‘RC2’), the closure date and the date of death recorded on the death certificate no longer need to match. It is recognised that the case may remain open for investigation and review procedures after the child dies; the date of death field allows local authorities to separately record the date of death and final case closure date in the census. This will allow local authorities to record the services they provide between the death and the case closure."

Under the Children Act 1989, local authorities are required to provide services for children in need for the purposes of safeguarding and promoting their welfare. Local authorities undertake assessments of the needs of individual children to determine what services to provide and action to take.
Assessments should be recorded only at significant points such as the beginning of a new episode of need. It is not necessary to log new assessments at the point of closing an episode of need.
As set out in 'Working together to safeguard children' (2018), where the outcome of the assessment is continued through an agreed plan of action, the plan should be reviewed regularly, the outcomes of these reviews do not need to be recorded. However, if the situation changes significantly, this may result in the need for the completion of a new assessment, in which case this new assessment should be recorded.
Include all assessments that fall entirely or partly in the 2022 to 2023 collection year, including those that had started but had not finished by 31 March 2023, and those that started prior to 1 April 2022 and were completed within the 2022 to 2023 collection year. Please note, if a child is referred to a local authority and has been classified as in need following an assessment they should be included in the children in need census, regardless of whether they are receiving youth offending or any other service.
Within one working day of a referral being received, a decision should be made about the type of response required. The maximum timeframe from the assessment to arrive at a decision on the action to be taken should be no longer than 45 working days from the point of referral. This should be recorded as the end date of the assessment. Assessments may lead to no further action, the direct provision of services, and section 47 enquiries. See 'Working together to safeguard children' for further information.
There must always be an assessment actual start date, but if the assessment authorisation date falls after the end of the census year, it should be left blank. The assessment internal review point date is optional."

• the impairment of the child’s health and development (‘Child’);
• the parent(s)/carer(s) capacity to respond to the child’s needs (‘Parenting capacity’);
• other people in the family/household, for example, a sibling or lodger (‘Other’).

This applies to all assessments completed.

The information should be recorded at the end of the assessment and all factors which are felt to be relevant to the child’s assessment should be reported from the list below. This includes factors where services are put in place to mitigate the effect of the factor as well as factors which need to be taken into account in providing other support.

Please only record factors which are currently an issue of concern. For example, if domestic violence is a current issue of concern, please record it. If domestic violence was an issue in a previous relationship and is not an issue of concern now, then do not record it. Factors such as mental health concerns do not need to be confined to medically defined conditions. Rather this is intended, for example, to record where the professional, as part of the assessment process, feels that mental health is of concern to the child’s health and development or parenting capacity to respond to the child’s needs.

Code 21 (no factors identified) should only be used for cases which are closed following assessments which result in no further action (closure code RC8 and RC9) and should be the only factor listed. However, if factors are identified for cases which are closed following assessment, please record these selecting from the list above, but excluding code 21.

If a section 47 enquiry has commenced on a case, then code 21 (no factors identified) should not be reported at the end of assessment even if it was found that the allegations that triggered the section 47 enquiry are unfounded. Instead, the relevant factors that were considered at the assessment that initiated the section 47 enquiry should be recorded. 
The case should then be closed using the reason for closure code: ‘RC7 - services ceased for any other reason, including child no longer in need’, as at the point the section 47 started the child would be counted as a child in need even if the case closed shortly after. 
Code 21 should only be used in cases where the section 47 enquiry was automatically triggered alongside the assessment and both the assessment and section 47 resulted in no further action.

More detailed descriptions and definitions of the factors are provided in the ‘Additional guide on the factors identified at the end of assessment’ for more information. The additional guide is available as part of the Children in need census: guide to submitting data. "

For the first episode in the year, this date can be in the current data year, or an earlier data year. When loading data using CSV or XML, dates must be recorded in a DD/MM/YYYY format. Example: 4 November 2023 should be entered as 04/11/2023.
Exceptionally, once loaded, the dates in the episode fields will appear as DD/MM/YY (year as a 2-digit number). Manual amendments to episode dates may be made using either format DD/MM/YY or DD/MM/YYYY, though the latter will appear as DD/MM/YY when saved). This is intended to make the episodes easier to read and manually amend, particularly when a record contains several episodes.
Where episodes are consecutive, the new episode must start on the same day that the previous episode finished.
When recording an agreement to provide a series of short-term placements (legal status V3/V4), enter in this field the date the first placement under the agreement began. For further information about children being looked-after under a series of short-term placements see Section 1.10.
Where an episode began in a previous statistical year, but is still open on 31 March, do not complete ‘Reason Episode Ceased’ or ‘Date Episode Ceased’. The following year’s record must then start with the same episode details showing the actual date the episode commenced if the episode subsequently closes, both the ‘Reason 
Episode Ceased’ and the ‘Date Episode Ceased’ should be recorded).
Episodes cannot start and end on the same day. If a child has two changes of legal status in one day only the second legal status is recorded. Similarly, in the unlikely event of two placements starting on the same day, only the status at the end of the day should be recorded. In such cases we no longer regard the first move of the day 
as being a placement. It follows from this that an essential component of a placement for SSDA903 purposes is that a placement must involve an overnight stay. A ‘placement’ that does not include an overnight stay should be regarded as a ‘visit’ and not shown on the SSDA903."

Also use code S when recording agreements to provide short-term placements (legal status V4), and for individual breaks under such an agreement, if these are being recorded separately (legal status V3).
Use Code L where there is a change of legal status, but the placement does not change. By ‘legal status’ we mean the legal status underlying the fact that the child is looked-after.
Use Code P where there is a change of placement and carer, but the legal status does not change. This would include the following scenarios:
• Move from one foster carer to another foster carer (for example, U3 to another U3 placement type code).
• Move from a foster carer to a children’s home (for example, U3 to K2 placement types).
In both scenarios there has been a change of carer. When a child is living independently, a new episode should be created each time they move, and code P should be used.
Use Code T where there is a change of placement, but the child remains with the same carer and the legal status does not change. This would include the following scenarios:
• Child moves to a new house with current foster carer (either inside or outside of local authority boundary).
• Child remains with same carer or within same setting but either the URN of the setting changes or the provider type changes (for example, a foster carer moves from an IFA to the local authority provider, or a placement for adoption transferring to a regional adoption agency, or an unregulated independent or 
semi independent setting registering with Ofsted).
In both scenarios, the child has remained with the same carer, but for some other reason, a new placement is required on the SSDA903.
Use Code B where both legal status and placement change, with a change of carer, on the same day. The two changes do not need to be simultaneous or consequent one upon the other. The code simply reflects that there was a change in carer and a change in legal status, for whatever reason, on the same day.
Use Code U where both legal status and placement change on the same day, but the child remains with the same carer. The two changes do not need to be simultaneous or consequent one upon the other. The code simply reflects that there was a change in placement and a change in legal status, for whatever reason, on the same day."
