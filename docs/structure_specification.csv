A child ID should not be reused after a period of time, it should be unique to a single child in your local authority. It can include alphabetic and numeric characters. Do not use non-numeric or non-alphabetic characters. 
This item is the sole means of DfE computer identification of each child record. The system is currently set to strip out any leading zeros in child identifiers. We would therefore ask local authorities not to use leading zeros in child identifiers.
If you are planning to change child identifiers, for example as part of a new computer scheme, DfE must be advised at an early stage.

> Child,> Identity,> Legal Status,,,legal_status,,,,Legal Status,Legal Status,"The legal status code on the SSDA903 records the legal status underlying being ‘looked-after’. If a child is looked-after because it is accommodated, the legal status goes some way to describe (in legal terms at least) why the child is being looked after. There are many legal statuses arising from the Children Act, or the Youth Justice System, to which a child can be subject, but which have no bearing on whether a child is ‘looked-after’ or not. These are not recorded on the SSDA903, and no legal status codes are provided for them.
The renewal of an existing legal status does not automatically generate a new episode. If the legal status code does not change, a new episode is not required (unless there happens to be a change of placement at the same time).
Example: If a child is already looked-after under an interim care order, a renewal of the interim care order does not change the legal status and no new episode is required. However, if a child looked-after under an interim care order becomes the subject of a full care order, then a new episode is required to record the start of the full care order.
In certain circumstances a child being looked-after can have more than one ‘lookedafter’ legal status. In general, this happens when a child who is already ‘looked-after’ under a Children Act care order comes into contact with the Youth Justice System, and as a result is detained in local authority accommodation under a second legal status. Two legal statuses cannot be shown as current on SSDA903. In such cases the latest legal status should be recorded and the episode under the previous status should be closed
Example: A child who is already subject to a care order is remanded to local authority accommodation under Section 23 (1) of CYPA 1969. The care order episode should be closed, and a new episode should start under the “remanded to local authority accommodation” legal status code. When the episode under the remand status ends, a further episode under the care order legal status will start, unless the care order has been discharged.
We have attempted to identify and provide a code for every legal status which theoretically could underpin a child being ‘looked-after’. If future changes in legislation lead to new ‘looked-after’ legal statuses, we will provide new legal status codes. Our analysis of the use of the former legal status code 98 showed that in most cases such children were either not looked-after, or that another existing legal status was appropriate.
The ‘wardship’ legal status code was a possible legal status identified by some local authorities in the consultation exercise on the future of the SSDA903 codes for which we did not have an existing legal status. However, the use of this code was restricted to just a few exceptional cases where the High Court has exercised its residual power to make a child a ward of the High Court, and has directed that the child should be accommodated by a local authority. In practice such cases werefound to be so extremely rare, it was felt that the use of a separate code could not be warranted. If such a case should arise, it should be coded C2, as the practical effects are the same.",SSDA903 | CIN,liquid_logic | mosaic,,

For the first episode in the year, this date can be in the current data year, or an earlier data year. When loading data using CSV or XML, dates must be recorded in a DD/MM/YYYY format. Example: 4 November 2023 should be entered as 04/11/2023.
Exceptionally, once loaded, the dates in the episode fields will appear as DD/MM/YY (year as a 2-digit number). Manual amendments to episode dates may be made using either format DD/MM/YY or DD/MM/YYYY, though the latter will appear as DD/MM/YY when saved). This is intended to make the episodes easier to read and manually amend, particularly when a record contains several episodes.
Where episodes are consecutive, the new episode must start on the same day that the previous episode finished.
When recording an agreement to provide a series of short-term placements (legal status V3/V4), enter in this field the date the first placement under the agreement began. For further information about children being looked-after under a series of short-term placements see Section 1.10.
Where an episode began in a previous statistical year, but is still open on 31 March, do not complete ‘Reason Episode Ceased’ or ‘Date Episode Ceased’. The following year’s record must then start with the same episode details showing the actual date the episode commenced if the episode subsequently closes, both the ‘Reason 
Episode Ceased’ and the ‘Date Episode Ceased’ should be recorded).
Episodes cannot start and end on the same day. If a child has two changes of legal status in one day only the second legal status is recorded. Similarly, in the unlikely event of two placements starting on the same day, only the status at the end of the day should be recorded. In such cases we no longer regard the first move of the day 
as being a placement. It follows from this that an essential component of a placement for SSDA903 purposes is that a placement must involve an overnight stay. A ‘placement’ that does not include an overnight stay should be regarded as a ‘visit’ and not shown on the SSDA903.",SSDA903 | CIN,liquid_logic | mosaic,,
> Child,> CLA Episodes,,,,cla_episodes,,,,Reason for New CLA Episode,Reason for New CLA Episode,"Use Code S where a child is starting to be looked-after for the first time, or had previously ceased to be looked-after, and is now starting to be looked-after again. 
Also use code S when recording agreements to provide short-term placements (legal status V4), and for individual breaks under such an agreement, if these are being recorded separately (legal status V3).
Use Code L where there is a change of legal status, but the placement does not change. By ‘legal status’ we mean the legal status underlying the fact that the child is looked-after.
Use Code P where there is a change of placement and carer, but the legal status does not change. This would include the following scenarios:
• Move from one foster carer to another foster carer (for example, U3 to another U3 placement type code).
• Move from a foster carer to a children’s home (for example, U3 to K2 placement types).
In both scenarios there has been a change of carer. When a child is living independently, a new episode should be created each time they move, and code P should be used.
Use Code T where there is a change of placement, but the child remains with the same carer and the legal status does not change. This would include the following scenarios:
• Child moves to a new house with current foster carer (either inside or outside of local authority boundary).
• Child remains with same carer or within same setting but either the URN of the setting changes or the provider type changes (for example, a foster carer moves from an IFA to the local authority provider, or a placement for adoption transferring to a regional adoption agency, or an unregulated independent or 
semi independent setting registering with Ofsted).
In both scenarios, the child has remained with the same carer, but for some other reason, a new placement is required on the SSDA903.
Use Code B where both legal status and placement change, with a change of carer, on the same day. The two changes do not need to be simultaneous or consequent one upon the other. The code simply reflects that there was a change in carer and a change in legal status, for whatever reason, on the same day.
Use Code U where both legal status and placement change on the same day, but the child remains with the same carer. The two changes do not need to be simultaneous or consequent one upon the other. The code simply reflects that there was a change in placement and a change in legal status, for whatever reason, on the same day.",SSDA903 | CIN,liquid_logic | mosaic,,
