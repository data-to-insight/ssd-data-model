    guidance: Was the conference quorate? The primary principle for determining quoracy
      is that there should be sufficient agencies or key disciplines present to enable
      safe decisions to be made in the individual circumstances. Minimum representation
      is Children's Social Care and at least two other agencies or key disciplines
      that have had direct contact with the child and family. In a case relating to
      fabricated or induced illness, it is important to ensure the paediatrician is
      able to attend.
