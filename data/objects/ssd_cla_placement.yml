    guidance: "A new requirement was introduced in the collection year 2015 to 2016,\
      \ to return the unique reference number (URN) where the setting is subject to\
      \ Ofsted inspections.\nFor children\u2019s homes this would be the URN of the\
      \ individual home and for foster or adoptive placements this would be the URN\
      \ of the relevant service or agency providing the placement. For larger providers\
      \ with multiple settings or branches the precise URN for the particular setting\
      \ or branch is required.\nIn some cases, it will be valid to provide different\
      \ information to that registered with Ofsted, for example if a child is placed\
      \ at the provider but at a different postcode to the main site. This could be\
      \ the case if a child is residing in a dormitory with a different postcode to\
      \ the registered site. Here the actual postcode where the child resides should\
      \ be reported.\nThe URN is in the format SC999999 or 9999999 for newly registered\
      \ providers. Note that secure training centres may have both a 6-digit education\
      \ URN and a 7-digit social care URN and it is the 7-digit social care URN which\
      \ should be returned in the SSDA903. Where local authorities are certain that\
      \ a provider is not inspected by Ofsted but is inspected by the Care Quality\
      \ Commission (CQC) or Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) then the code \u2018\
      XXXXXXX\u2019 should be used. Similarly, the code \u2018XXXXXXX\u2019 should\
      \ be used when the provider is a regional adoption agency. Where placements\
      \ are of a type or in a setting not inspected by Ofsted, such as placed with\
      \ parents, then no URN is expected."

    guidance: "Reason for placement change. The reason for placement change should\
      \ be recorded against the episode that is ceasing, not against the new episode\
      \ starting.\nCode set\nCARPL - Change to/Implementation of Care Plan\nThis code\
      \ would be used where the change of placement is a planned part of the child\u2019\
      s care plan and will be a move to a placement that meets the child\u2019s assessed\
      \ needs on a temporary or permanent basis. This would include circumstances\
      \ where a placement change was not expected but becomes necessary. The key factor\
      \ is that planning takes place and the decision is recorded in the child\u2019\
      s care plan before the change takes place. This would include moves from short\
      \ to long term foster care or where a child is placed for adoption with the\
      \ current foster carer. It also includes movements to semi-independence. The\
      \ nature of the change in plan will be monitored through the placement codes\
      \ before and after this move. This should not include changes where the foster\
      \ carer has moved to a new house or where the carer is the same but has changed\
      \ provider type.\nCLOSE - Resignation/ closure of provision\nThis code would\
      \ be used where a child has to be moved because a foster carer decides to resign\
      \ or the setting closes. This code would be used in a planned move; not in an\
      \ emergency. The foster carer\u2019s decision to resign may be because their\
      \ circumstances have changed, for example, the foster carer becomes ill or another\
      \ change of circumstances means that the foster carer is no longer able to provide\
      \ a placement for the child. Circumstances may also include where the child\u2019\
      s placement had lasted longer than expected and the foster carer is no longer\
      \ able to provide a placement for the child. Use of this code would also include\
      \ where a setting (for example, a children\u2019s home or a fostering service)\
      \ closes and is therefore no longer a registered provision with Ofsted.\nALLEG\
      \ - Allegation (s47)\nThis code would be used where a child has been removed\
      \ from placement because of an allegation which is being investigated under\
      \ s47 (Children Act 1989). This allegation may relate to the carer or another\
      \ child at the setting. This code should not be used if the allegation has resulted\
      \ in the setting\u2019s approval (for example, a children\u2019s home or a fostering\
      \ service) being terminated \u2013 in this case, \u2018approval removed\u2019\
      \ should be used.\nSTAND - Standards of care concern\nThis code would be used\
      \ where a child has been removed from placement by the responsible authority\
      \ or provider as a result of concerns about standards of care. This does not\
      \ mean a child protection investigation (s47) but a formal process followed\
      \ by the provider. For example, see the National Minimum Standards for Fostering\
      \ Service 2011, standard. 22. This code can be used for all types of placement\
      \ such as foster care, residential care. This code should not be used if the\
      \ setting\u2019s approval is terminated as a result of standards of care concerns\
      \ \u2013 in this case, \u2018approval removed\u2019 should be used.\nCUSTOD\
      \ - Custody arrangement\nThis code would be used where a child has been admitted\
      \ into custody.\nAPPRR Approval removed\nThis code would be used where a setting\
      \ is no longer approved/registered with the appropriate statutory body (such\
      \ as Ofsted). This code can be used for all types of placement such as foster\
      \ care, residential care. For example, this code should be used where a foster\
      \ carer\u2019s approval is terminated by the service following a s47 investigation,\
      \ a standards of care issue, a complaint or for other reasons that relate to\
      \ the carers\u2019 conduct. It should also be used where Ofsted take enforcement\
      \ action resulting in the closure of a residential setting. This code should\
      \ not be used when a foster carer resigns or a provision is closed voluntarily\
      \ and they are no longer registered with the relevant statutory body (such as\
      \ Ofsted).\nCREQB - Carer(s) requests placement end due to child\u2019s behaviour\n\
      This code would be used where because of the child\u2019s behaviour the placement\
      \ has broken down or disrupted, and the carer has asked for the placement to\
      \ end and the child to be moved to another placement. There may be some planning\
      \ involved and a short period of time may pass but this is not a planned move.\n\
      CREQO - Carer(s) requests placement end other than due to child\u2019s behaviour\n\
      These codes would be used where it was intended that the placement was a short\
      \ or long term arrangement but has broken down or disrupted and the carer [foster\
      \ carer, residential unit or connected person] has asked for the child to be\
      \ moved to another placement. There may be some planning involved and a short\
      \ period of time may pass but this is not a planned move.\nCHILD - Child requests\
      \ placement end\nThis code would be used where it was intended that the placement\
      \ was a short- or long-term arrangement but has broken down or disrupted and\
      \ the child has asked to move to another placement. There may be some planning\
      \ involved and a short period of time may pass but this is not a planned move.\n\
      LAREQ - Responsible/area authority requests placement end\nThis code would be\
      \ used where it was intended that the placement was a short- or long-term placement\
      \ but the responsible authority has decided that the placement no longer meets\
      \ the child\u2019s needs. There may be some planning involved and a short period\
      \ of time may pass but this is not a planned move. There will be circumstances\
      \ where the child is at risk of harm and this would be coded as an allegation\
      \ or standards of care concern. Where the placement no longer meets a child\u2019\
      s need but there is no immediate risk \u2013 this code would be used.\nPLACE\
      \ - Change in the status of placement only\nThis code would be used where there\
      \ is a change of status for the placement, but the child remains with the same\
      \ carer and there is no change to the care plan. Examples include a foster carer\
      \ moving to a new house, a foster carer working for a local authority becomes\
      \ managed by an independent fostering agency, a placement for adoption transferring\
      \ to a regional adoption agency, or a child in residential accommodation moving\
      \ under the same provider. Here the \u2018reason for new episode\u2019 code\
      \ will indicate that the child is still living with the same carer.\nOTHER -\
      \ Other\nAny other reason not captured above. Please note that \u2019Other\u2019\
      \ should only be used in exceptional circumstances."
