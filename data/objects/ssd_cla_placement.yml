      \ provider and paragraph 2.2.6 on placement location in this guide for further\
      \ details.\nSome care is required when coding placement types, as there can\
      \ be instances where a child remains living at the same location, but the placement\
      \ code changes, and a new episode is required. There are also a few cases where\
      \ a change of placement should not be recorded on the SSDA903, and those where\
      \ the local authority has the option of whether to record them or not.\nA change\
      \ of placement can happen either when a child:\n\u2022 Moves to a new placement,\
      \ even if this does not require using a different placement code (this is the\
      \ most frequent kind of placement change); or\n\u2022 If the child remains at\

    guidance: "A new requirement was introduced in the collection year 2015 to 2016,\
      \ to return the unique reference number (URN) where the setting is subject to\
      \ Ofsted inspections.\nFor children\u2019s homes this would be the URN of the\
      \ individual home and for foster or adoptive placements this would be the URN\
      \ of the relevant service or agency providing the placement. For larger providers\
      \ with multiple settings or branches the precise URN for the particular setting\
      \ or branch is required.\nThe data, which will cover roughly 90% of all placements,\
      \ will be used to map placement use in a more accurate way than previously possible\
      \ to enable better understanding of placement patterns and to help improve understanding\
      \ of why children are placed in certain placements and how this can impact on\
      \ them. It will give a better understanding of the market for children\u2019\
      s homes and the use of independent fostering and adoption providers so that\
      \ government can consider appropriate policy responses to help the sufficiency\
      \ of the market. It is anticipated that local authorities will find the additional\
      \ data helpful, for instance by linking Ofsted quality ratings to provision.\n\
      In some cases, it will be valid to provide different information to that registered\
      \ with Ofsted, for example if a child is placed at the provider but at a different\
      \ postcode to the main site. This could be the case if a child is residing in\
      \ a dormitory with a different postcode to the registered site. Here the actual\
      \ postcode where the child resides should be reported.\nThe URN is in the format\
      \ SC999999 or 9999999 for newly registered providers. Note that secure training\
      \ centres may have both a 6-digit education URN and a 7-digit social care URN\
      \ and it is the 7-digit social care URN which should be returned in the SSDA903.\
      \ Where local authorities are certain that a provider is not inspected by Ofsted\
      \ but is inspected by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) or Independent Schools\
      \ Inspectorate (ISI) then the code \u2018XXXXXXX\u2019 should be used. Similarly,\
      \ the code \u2018XXXXXXX\u2019 should be used when the provider is a regional\
      \ adoption agency.\nIt is possible there may be more than one URN for a provider,\
      \ for instance if it was bought by another company and so re-registered, so\
      \ it is important local authorities return the valid social care URN for the\
      \ latest date the child was placed at the provider. If a provider has been de-registered,\
      \ we expect the local authority to close the episode of care at that URN. Where\
      \ the child remains with the same provider, but the URN has changed because\
      \ of administrative changes, (for example, a change from the local authority\u2019\
      s children\u2019s services to a children\u2019s Trust that is registered with\
      \ Ofsted), the local authority should add a new episode and use \u2018T\u2019\
      \ code for reason for new episode.\nPlease do not use the Ofsted website to\
      \ obtain provider social care URNs. It is designed to allow the general public\
      \ to find inspection reports across all Ofsted remits, rather than being a general\
      \ search tool. There are legitimate numbers it won\u2019t recognise and there\
      \ are other inspected premises you will not be able to find (for example children\u2019\
      s homes when searching by address details); nor will it provide both social\
      \ care and education URNs where a provider has both.\nOfsted are happy to advise\
      \ and confirm the URN that should be provided in the CLA return if you have\
      \ any queries. As a minimum, please provide them with the setting name, address\
      \ and postcode. Their contact team email address is socialcaredata@ofsted.gov.uk\
      \ and their contact team telephone number is 03000 130020.\nWhere placements\
      \ are of a type or in a setting not inspected by Ofsted, such as placed with\
      \ parents, then no URN is expected."

      \ below. The reason for placement change should be recorded against the episode\
      \ that is ceasing, not against the new episode starting. CARPL Change to/Implementation\
      \ of Care Plan\nThis code would be used where the change of placement is a planned\
      \ part of the child\u2019s care plan and will be a move to a placement that\
      \ meets the child\u2019s assessed needs on a temporary or permanent basis. This\
      \ would include circumstances where a placement change was not expected but\
      \ becomes necessary. The key factor is that planning takes place and the decision\
      \ is recorded in the child\u2019s care plan before the change takes place. This\
      \ would include moves from short to long term foster care or where a child is\
      \ placed for adoption with the current foster carer. It also includes movements\
      \ to semi-independence. The nature of the change in plan will be monitored through\
      \ the placement codes before and after this move. This should not include changes\
      \ where the foster carer has moved to a new house or where the carer is the\
      \ same but has changed provider type.\nCLOSE Resignation/ closure of provision\n\
      This code would be used where a child has to be moved because a foster carer\
      \ decides to resign or the setting closes. This code would be used in a planned\
      \ move; not in an emergency. The foster carer\u2019s decision to resign may\
      \ be because their circumstances have changed, for example, the foster carer\
      \ becomes ill or another change of circumstances means that the foster carer\
      \ is no longer able to provide a placement for the child. Circumstances may\
      \ also include where the child\u2019s placement had lasted longer than expected\
      \ and the foster carer is no longer able to provide a placement for the child.\
      \ Use of this code would also include where a setting (for example, a children\u2019\
      s home or a fostering service) closes and is therefore no longer a registered\
      \ provision with Ofsted.\nALLEG Allegation (s47)\nThis code would be used where\
      \ a child has been removed from placement because of an allegation which is\
      \ being investigated under s47 (Children Act 1989). This allegation may relate\
      \ to the carer or another child at the setting. This code should not be used\
      \ if the allegation has resulted in the setting\u2019s approval (for example,\
      \ a children\u2019s home or a fostering service) being terminated \u2013 in\
      \ this case, \u2018approval removed\u2019 should be used.\nSTAND Standards of\
      \ care concern\nThis code would be used where a child has been removed from\
      \ placement by the responsible authority or provider as a result of concerns\
      \ about standards of care. This does not mean a child protection investigation\
      \ (s47) but a formal process followed by the provider. For example, see the\
      \ National Minimum Standards for Fostering Service 2011, standard. 22. This\
      \ code can be used for all types of placement such as foster care, residential\
      \ care. This code should not be used if the setting\u2019s approval is terminated\
      \ as a result of standards of care concerns \u2013 in this case, \u2018approval\
      \ removed\u2019 should be used.\nCUSTOD Custody arrangement\nThis code would\
      \ be used where a child has been admitted into custody. APPRR Approval removed\n\
      This code would be used where a setting is no longer approved/registered with\
      \ the appropriate statutory body (such as Ofsted). This code can be used for\
      \ all types of placement such as foster care, residential care. For example,\
      \ this code should be used where a foster carer\u2019s approval is terminated\
      \ by the service following a s47 investigation, a standards of care issue, a\
      \ complaint or for other reasons that relate to the carers\u2019 conduct. It\
      \ should also be used where Ofsted take enforcement action resulting in the\
      \ closure of a residential setting. This code should not be used when a foster\
      \ carer resigns or a provision is closed voluntarily and they are no longer\
      \ registered with the relevant statutory body (such as Ofsted).\nCREQB Carer(s)\
      \ requests placement end due to child\u2019s behaviour\nThis code would be used\
      \ where because of the child\u2019s behaviour the placement has broken down\
      \ or disrupted, and the carer has asked for the placement to end and the child\
      \ to be moved to another placement. There may be some planning involved and\
      \ a short period of time may pass but this is not a planned move.\nCREQO Carer(s)\
      \ requests placement end other than due to child\u2019s behaviour\nThese codes\
      \ would be used where it was intended that the placement was a short or long\

      \ residential unit or connected person] has asked for the child to be moved\
      \ to another placement. There may be some planning involved and a short period\

      \ end\nThis code would be used where it was intended that the placement was\
      \ a short- or long-term arrangement but has broken down or disrupted and the\
      \ child has asked to move to another placement. There may be some planning involved\
      \ and a short period of time may pass but this is not a planned move.\nLAREQ\
      \ Responsible/area authority requests placement end\nThis code would be used\
      \ where it was intended that the placement was a short- or long-term placement\
      \ but the responsible authority has decided that the placement no longer meets\
      \ the child\u2019s needs. There may be some planning involved and a short period\
      \ of time may pass but this is not a planned move. There will be circumstances\
      \ where the child is at risk of harm and this would be coded as an allegation\
      \ or standards of care concern. Where the placement no longer meets a child\u2019\
      s need but there is no immediate risk \u2013 this code would be used.\nPLACE\
      \ Change in the status of placement only\nThis code would be used where there\
      \ is a change of status for the placement, but the child remains with the same\
      \ carer and there is no change to the care plan. Examples include a foster carer\
      \ moving to a new house, a foster carer working for a local authority becomes\
      \ managed by an independent fostering agency, a placement for adoption transferring\
      \ to a regional adoption agency, or a child in residential accommodation moving\
      \ under the same provider. Here the \u2018reason for new episode\u2019 code\
      \ will indicate that the child is still living with the same carer.\nOTHER Other\n\
      Any other reason not captured above. Please note that \u2019Other\u2019 should\
      \ only be used in exceptional circumstances."
