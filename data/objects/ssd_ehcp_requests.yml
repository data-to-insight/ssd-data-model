    guidance: "EHCP request record unique ID from system or auto-generated as part\
      \ of export. The following information should be recorded for each initial request\
      \ for assessment made to the local authority. The information collected will\
      \ allow the department to continue to report on the timeliness of the assessment\
      \ process. Requests that have yet to be completed should also be recorded.\n\
      If a child or young person transfers into the local authority\u2019s area at\
      \ any stage of the request and assessment process before an EHC plan has been\
      \ issued, there is no right of transfer of decisions made by the originating\
      \ local authority. Under good practice local authorities may decide to share\
      \ information but the importing local authority must make its own decisions\
      \ on whether to assess and whether to issue a plan.\nWhere a person with an\
      \ existing EHC plan transfers into the local authority\u2019s area (item 5.1)\
      \ the request and assessment should be recorded by the importing local authority\
      \ as historical even if the EHC plan start date is within the collection year."
