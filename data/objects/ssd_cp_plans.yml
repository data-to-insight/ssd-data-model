    guidance: CP Plan unique ID from system or auto-generated as part of export. This
      module contains information on child protection plans. A child can have none,
      one or more than one child protection plan (CPP). A child who is not in need
      cannot have a child protection plan. The collection allows more than one plan
      review date to be provided and all reviews within the year should be included.
      A child protection plan being transferred from another local authority should
      be recorded as a new plan, even if the child had previously received services
      in the local authority they are transferring to.

    guidance: "Using the code set in the table below record the category of abuse\
      \ as assessed when the child protection plan commenced and any subsequent category\
      \ of abuse assigned to the child protection plan. The latest category of abuse\
      \ may be the same as the initial category of abuse. -NEG Neglect\n-PHY Physical\
      \ abuse\n-SAB Sexual abuse\n-EMO Emotional abuse\n-MUL Multiple/not recommended\
      \ The multiple category is for when more than one category of abuse is relevant\
      \ to the child\u2019s current protection plan. It is not intended to record\
      \ information for children who have been the subject of more than one child\
      \ protection plan during the year.\nThe category of abuse under which a child\
      \ is made the subject of a child protection plan will have been decided upon\
      \ at the child protection conference. However, if the category of abuse applicable\
      \ to the current child protection plan has changed as a result of subsequent\
      \ child protection conferences, then enter the latest category of abuse. Overall,\
      \ the initial category of abuse is that decided upon at the conference; any\
      \ amended category is to be recorded as the latest category of abuse. The categories\
      \ are defined for the purpose of this collection as follows:\n-Neglect\nNeglect\
      \ is the persistent failure to meet a child\u2019s basic physical and/or psychological\
      \ needs, which is likely to result in the serious impairment of the child\u2019\
      s health or development. For instance, a parent or carer may fail to:\n\u2022\
      \ provide adequate food, shelter, or clothing (including exclusion from home\
      \ or abandonment);\n\u2022 protect a child from physical harm, emotional harm,\
      \ or danger;\n\u2022 ensure adequate supervision (including the use of inadequate\
      \ care-givers);\n\u2022 ensure access to appropriate medical care or treatment.\n\
      It may also include neglect of, or unresponsiveness to, a child\u2019s basic\
      \ emotional needs.\nMore information on childhood neglect including training\
      \ and resource materials can be found in Safeguarding children. -Physical abuse\n\
      Physical abuse may involve hitting, shaking, throwing, poisoning, burning or\
      \ scalding, drowning, suffocating, or otherwise causing physical harm to a child.\
      \ Physical harm may also be caused when a parent or carer deliberately fabricates\
      \ symptoms or induces illness in a child. The fabrication and deliberate inducement\
      \ or symptoms relate to conditions such as Munchausen syndrome by proxy.\n-Sexual\
      \ abuse\nSexual abuse involves forcing or enticing a child to take part in sexual\
      \ activities, including prostitution, regardless of whether or not the child\
      \ is aware of what is happening. Such activities may involve physical contact,\
      \ including non-penetrative and penetrative acts (for example rape, buggery,\
      \ or oral sex) or non-penetrative acts such as masturbation, kissing, rubbing\
      \ and touching outside of clothing. They may also include non-contact activities,\
      \ such as involving children in looking at, or in the production of, sexual\
      \ images, watching sexual activities, encouraging children to behave in sexually\
      \ inappropriate ways, or grooming a child in preparation for abuse (including\
      \ via the internet). Sexual abuse is not solely perpetrated by adult males.\
      \ Women can also commit acts of sexual abuse, as can other children.\n-Emotional\
      \ abuse\nEmotional abuse is the persistent ill-treatment of a child that causes\
      \ severe and continual adverse effects on the child\u2019s emotional development.\
      \ It may involve conveying to the child that they are inadequate, worthless\
      \ or unloved, or valued only as far as they meet the needs of another person.\
      \ It may include not giving the child opportunities to express their views,\
      \ deliberately silencing them or making fun of what they say or how they communicate.\
      \ It may feature the imposing of age or developmentally inappropriate expectations\
      \ on the child. Such expectations may include interactions that are beyond the\
      \ child\u2019s developmental capability. It includes overprotection and limitation\
      \ of exploration and learning, or preventing the child from participating in\
      \ normal social interactions. It may involve the child seeing or hearing the\
      \ ill-treatment of another. It may also involve serious bullying (including\
      \ cyber bullying), causing children frequently to feel frightened or in danger,\
      \ or the exploitation or corruption of children. Some level of emotional abuse\
      \ is implied in all types of ill-treatment of a child, although it may occur\
      \ on its own. Use this category when it is the main or sole form of abuse.\n\
      -Multiple/not recommended\nThis category is used to record multiple categories\
      \ or where no category is recommended."
