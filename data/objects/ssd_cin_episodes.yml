    guidance: "CIN Primary Need Code. This code indicates the main reason why a child\
      \ started to receive services. The categories are designed only to identify\
      \ what kind of pressures are placed on social services. They have no diagnostic\
      \ value with regard to the children themselves and must not be used to determine\
      \ what type of service the child should receive.\nIf there is difficulty choosing\
      \ between two or more categories of need, choose the category that comes highest\
      \ up in the table, for example, if trying to decide between family in acute\
      \ stress and family dysfunction, choose family in acute stress.\nThe order of\
      \ the categories relates to the specificity of the description and not necessarily\
      \ importance. However, the order is fixed so that there is consistency.\nThe\
      \ children in need census for 2005 and earlier tried to account for all money\
      \ spent in a census week. To allow for this, \u2018N9\u2019 was created, but\
      \ as this census is specifically child based, the definition of \u2018N9\u2019\
      \ from 2005 is not applicable. As in previous years, \u2018N9\u2019 can be used\
      \ if a child is no longer in need and the only service they are receiving is\
      \ adoption support (on an open case) immediately after they have been in need.\n\
      Code Set\nN1 - Abuse or neglect\nChildren in need as a result of, or at risk\
      \ of, abuse or neglect; also includes children at risk because of domestic violence.\n\
      N2 - Child\u2019s disability\nChildren and families whose main need for services\
      \ arises because of their child\u2019s disability, illness or intrinsic condition.\n\
      N3 - Parental disability or illness\nChildren whose main need for services arises\
      \ because the capacity of their parent(s) (or carer(s)) to care for them is\
      \ impaired by the parent(s) (or carer(s)) disability, physical or mental illness,\
      \ or addictions.\nN4 - Family in acute stress\nChildren whose needs arise from\
      \ living in a family that is going through a temporary crisis that diminishes\
      \ the parental capacity to adequately meet some of the children\u2019s needs.\n\
      N5 - Family dysfunction\nChildren whose needs primarily arise from living in\
      \ a family where the parenting capacity is chronically inadequate.\nN6 - Socially\
      \ unacceptable behaviour\nChildren and families whose need for services primarily\
      \ arise out of the child\u2019s behaviour impacting detrimentally on the community.\n\
      N7 - Low income\nChildren, living in families or independently, whose needs\
      \ primarily arise from being dependent on an income below the standard state\
      \ entitlements.\nN8 - Absent parenting\nChildren whose needs for services arise\
      \ mainly from having no parents available to provide for them.\nN9 - Cases other\
      \ than children in need\nChildren who have been adopted and, although they are\
      \ no longer a child in need, receive adoption support from children\u2019s social\
      \ services immediately after adoption. This should not be used where a child\
      \ receives an adoption payment only.\nN0 - Not stated\nChildren whose reference\
      \ data is not completely entered on the system and whose need code is yet to\
      \ be determined, or the case is a referral that has been closed following assessment."
