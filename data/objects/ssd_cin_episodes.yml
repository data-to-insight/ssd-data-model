    guidance: "This code indicates the main reason why a child started to receive\
      \ services. It should not be left blank. Only one reason can be recorded.\n\
      If a child is also looked after, the primary need code for children in need\
      \ might not necessarily be the same as that recorded in the children looked\
      \ after data collection. For example, this may occur if a child became looked\
      \ after at a later date than when they became a child in need.\nThe categories\
      \ are designed only to identify what kind of pressures are placed on social\
      \ services. They have no diagnostic value with regard to the children themselves\
      \ and must not be used to determine what type of service the child should receive.\n\
      If there is difficulty choosing between two or more categories of need, choose\
      \ the category that comes highest up in the table, for example, if trying to\
      \ decide between family in acute stress and family dysfunction, choose family\
      \ in acute stress.\nThe order of the categories relates to the specificity of\
      \ the description and not necessarily importance. However, the order is fixed\
      \ so that there is consistency.\nFurther information on choosing a primary need\
      \ category is in appendix A.\nThe children in need census for 2005 and earlier\
      \ tried to account for all money spent in a census week. To allow for this,\
      \ \u2018N9\u2019 was created, but as this census is specifically child based,\
      \ the definition of \u2018N9\u2019 from 2005 is not applicable. As in previous\
      \ years, \u2018N9\u2019 can be used if a child is no longer in need and the\
      \ only service they are receiving is adoption support (on an open case) immediately\
      \ after they have been in need. Enter the primary need code, selecting from\
      \ the table below:\n-N1 Abuse or neglect\nChildren in need as a result of, or\
      \ at risk of, abuse or neglect; also includes children at risk because of domestic\
      \ violence.\n-N2 Child\u2019s disability\nChildren and families whose main need\
      \ for services arises because of their child\u2019s disability, illness or intrinsic\
      \ condition.\n-N3 Parental disability or illness\nChildren whose main need for\
      \ services arises because the capacity of their parent(s) (or carer(s)) to care\
      \ for them is impaired by the parent(s) (or carer(s)) disability, physical or\
      \ mental illness, or addictions.\n-N4 Family in acute stress\nChildren whose\
      \ needs arise from living in a family that is going through a temporary crisis\
      \ that diminishes the parental capacity to adequately meet some of the children\u2019\
      s needs.\n-N5 Family dysfunction\nChildren whose needs primarily arise from\
      \ living in a family where the parenting capacity is chronically inadequate.\n\
      -N6 Socially unacceptable behaviour\nChildren and families whose need for services\
      \ primarily arise out of the child\u2019s behaviour impacting detrimentally\
      \ on the community.\n-N7 Low income\nChildren, living in families or independently,\
      \ whose needs primarily arise from being dependent on an income below the standard\
      \ state entitlements.\n-N8 Absent parenting\nChildren whose needs for services\
      \ arise mainly from having no parents available to provide for them.\n-N9 Cases\
      \ other than children in need\nChildren who have been adopted and, although\
      \ they are no longer a child in need, receive adoption support from children\u2019\
      s social services immediately after adoption. This should not be used where\
      \ a child receives an adoption payment only as these children should not be\
      \ included in the census.\nThe previous definition of \u2018N9\u2019 from 2005\
      \ was casework which is required for a legal and administrative reason only\
      \ and there is no child in the case who is in need.\n-N0 Not stated\nChildren\
      \ whose reference data is not completely entered on the system and whose need\
      \ code is yet to be determined, or the case is a referral that has been closed\
      \ following assessment."

      \ for a child who they assess following a referral, but for whom they do not\

      \ authorities to categorise a case for a child who they assess following a referral,\
      \ but is subsequently referred to early help and whose case is then closed.\n\
      These are different from cases that were closed prior to assessment, at the\
      \ referral stage; the referral no further action flag should be used in these\
      \ cases (see section 4.3). The reason for closure codes RC8 and RC9 should not\

      \ and whose need code is yet to be determined, or where the case is a referral\
      \ that has been closed following assessment.\nWhen the reason for closure code\
      \ RC8 or RC9 is used the case should be closed on the same date as the assessment\
      \ ends or, if this is not practical, as soon as possible afterwards."

      \ in the case of adoption\nWhen a child\u2019s case is closed because of adoption\
      \ (reason for closure code \u2018RC1\u2019), the children in need closure date\
      \ will normally be the day when the court granted the adoption order.\nIt is\

      \ up to one month after the date of the adoption order without having to open\
      \ a new record. The need code would stay the same in these cases. Anything above\
      \ one month will require a new record to be created. If a child remains in need\

      \ child is stillborn (reason for closure code \u2018RC2\u2019), the closure\
      \ date and the date of death recorded on the death certificate no longer need\
      \ to match. It is recognised that the case may remain open for investigation\
      \ and review procedures after the child dies; the date of death field allows\
      \ local authorities to separately record the date of death and final case closure\
      \ date in the census. This will allow local authorities to record the services\
      \ they provide between the death and the case closure."
