    guidance: "This item records the date that each episode began. For the first episode\
      \ in the year, this date can be in the current data year, or an earlier data\
      \ year. When loading data using CSV or XML, dates must be recorded in a DD/MM/YYYY\
      \ format. Example: 4 November 2023 should be entered as 04/11/2023.\nExceptionally,\
      \ once loaded, the dates in the episode fields will appear as DD/MM/YY (year\
      \ as a 2-digit number). Manual amendments to episode dates may be made using\
      \ either format DD/MM/YY or DD/MM/YYYY, though the latter will appear as DD/MM/YY\
      \ when saved). This is intended to make the episodes easier to read and manually\
      \ amend, particularly when a record contains several episodes.\nWhere episodes\
      \ are consecutive, the new episode must start on the same day that the previous\
      \ episode finished.\nWhen recording an agreement to provide a series of short-term\
      \ placements (legal status V3/V4), enter in this field the date the first placement\
      \ under the agreement began. For further information about children being looked-after\
      \ under a series of short-term placements see Section 1.10.\nWhere an episode\
      \ began in a previous statistical year, but is still open on 31 March, do not\
      \ complete \u2018Reason Episode Ceased\u2019 or \u2018Date Episode Ceased\u2019\
      . The following year\u2019s record must then start with the same episode details\
      \ showing the actual date the episode commenced if the episode subsequently\
      \ closes, both the \u2018Reason Episode Ceased\u2019 and the \u2018Date Episode\
      \ Ceased\u2019 should be recorded).\nEpisodes cannot start and end on the same\
      \ day. If a child has two changes of legal status in one day only the second\
      \ legal status is recorded. Similarly, in the unlikely event of two placements\
      \ starting on the same day, only the status at the end of the day should be\
      \ recorded. In such cases we no longer regard the first move of the day as being\
      \ a placement. It follows from this that an essential component of a placement\
      \ for SSDA903 purposes is that a placement must involve an overnight stay. A\
      \ \u2018placement\u2019 that does not include an overnight stay should be regarded\
      \ as a \u2018visit\u2019 and not shown on the SSDA903."

    guidance: "Use Code S where a child is starting to be looked-after for the first\
      \ time, or had previously ceased to be looked-after, and is now starting to\
      \ be looked-after again. Also use code S when recording agreements to provide\
      \ short-term placements (legal status V4), and for individual breaks under such\
      \ an agreement, if these are being recorded separately (legal status V3).\n\
      Use Code L where there is a change of legal status, but the placement does not\
      \ change. By \u2018legal status\u2019 we mean the legal status underlying the\
      \ fact that the child is looked-after.\nUse Code P where there is a change of\
      \ placement and carer, but the legal status does not change. This would include\
      \ the following scenarios:\n\u2022 Move from one foster carer to another foster\
      \ carer (for example, U3 to another U3 placement type code).\n\u2022 Move from\
      \ a foster carer to a children\u2019s home (for example, U3 to K2 placement\
      \ types).\nIn both scenarios there has been a change of carer. When a child\
      \ is living independently, a new episode should be created each time they move,\
      \ and code P should be used.\nUse Code T where there is a change of placement,\
      \ but the child remains with the same carer and the legal status does not change.\
      \ This would include the following scenarios:\n\u2022 Child moves to a new house\
      \ with current foster carer (either inside or outside of local authority boundary).\n\
      \u2022 Child remains with same carer or within same setting but either the URN\
      \ of the setting changes or the provider type changes (for example, a foster\
      \ carer moves from an IFA to the local authority provider, or a placement for\
      \ adoption transferring to a regional adoption agency, or an unregulated independent\
      \ or semi independent setting registering with Ofsted).\nIn both scenarios,\
      \ the child has remained with the same carer, but for some other reason, a new\
      \ placement is required on the SSDA903.\nUse Code B where both legal status\
      \ and placement change, with a change of carer, on the same day. The two changes\
      \ do not need to be simultaneous or consequent one upon the other. The code\
      \ simply reflects that there was a change in carer and a change in legal status,\
      \ for whatever reason, on the same day.\nUse Code U where both legal status\
      \ and placement change on the same day, but the child remains with the same\
      \ carer. The two changes do not need to be simultaneous or consequent one upon\
      \ the other. The code simply reflects that there was a change in placement and\
      \ a change in legal status, for whatever reason, on the same day."

    guidance: "This code indicates the main reason why a child started to receive\
      \ services. It should not be left blank. Only one reason can be recorded.\n\
      If a child is also looked after, the primary need code for children in need\
      \ might not necessarily be the same as that recorded in the children looked\
      \ after data collection. For example, this may occur if a child became looked\
      \ after at a later date than when they became a child in need.\nThe categories\
      \ are designed only to identify what kind of pressures are placed on social\
      \ services. They have no diagnostic value with regard to the children themselves\
      \ and must not be used to determine what type of service the child should receive.\n\
      If there is difficulty choosing between two or more categories of need, choose\
      \ the category that comes highest up in the table, for example, if trying to\
      \ decide between family in acute stress and family dysfunction, choose family\
      \ in acute stress.\nThe order of the categories relates to the specificity of\
      \ the description and not necessarily importance. However, the order is fixed\
      \ so that there is consistency.\nFurther information on choosing a primary need\
      \ category is in appendix A.\nThe children in need census for 2005 and earlier\
      \ tried to account for all money spent in a census week. To allow for this,\
      \ \u2018N9\u2019 was created, but as this census is specifically child based,\
      \ the definition of \u2018N9\u2019 from 2005 is not applicable. As in previous\
      \ years, \u2018N9\u2019 can be used if a child is no longer in need and the\
      \ only service they are receiving is adoption support (on an open case) immediately\
      \ after they have been in need. Enter the primary need code, selecting from\
      \ the table below:\n-N1 Abuse or neglect\nChildren in need as a result of, or\
      \ at risk of, abuse or neglect; also includes children at risk because of domestic\
      \ violence.\n-N2 Child\u2019s disability\nChildren and families whose main need\
      \ for services arises because of their child\u2019s disability, illness or intrinsic\
      \ condition.\n-N3 Parental disability or illness\nChildren whose main need for\
      \ services arises because the capacity of their parent(s) (or carer(s)) to care\
      \ for them is impaired by the parent(s) (or carer(s)) disability, physical or\
      \ mental illness, or addictions.\n-N4 Family in acute stress\nChildren whose\
      \ needs arise from living in a family that is going through a temporary crisis\
      \ that diminishes the parental capacity to adequately meet some of the children\u2019\
      s needs.\n-N5 Family dysfunction\nChildren whose needs primarily arise from\
      \ living in a family where the parenting capacity is chronically inadequate.\n\
      -N6 Socially unacceptable behaviour\nChildren and families whose need for services\
      \ primarily arise out of the child\u2019s behaviour impacting detrimentally\
      \ on the community.\n-N7 Low income\nChildren, living in families or independently,\
      \ whose needs primarily arise from being dependent on an income below the standard\
      \ state entitlements.\n-N8 Absent parenting\nChildren whose needs for services\
      \ arise mainly from having no parents available to provide for them.\n-N9 Cases\
      \ other than children in need\nChildren who have been adopted and, although\
      \ they are no longer a child in need, receive adoption support from children\u2019\
      s social services immediately after adoption. This should not be used where\
      \ a child receives an adoption payment only as these children should not be\
      \ included in the census.\nThe previous definition of \u2018N9\u2019 from 2005\
      \ was casework which is required for a legal and administrative reason only\
      \ and there is no child in the case who is in need.\n-N0 Not stated\nChildren\
      \ whose reference data is not completely entered on the system and whose need\
      \ code is yet to be determined, or the case is a referral that has been closed\

      \ and has not been discussed as part of the care planning process or does not\
      \ occur within the planned timeframe. This would include instances where a child\
      \ under a voluntary arrangement is removed from care by their parents and this\
      \ was not agreed as part of the care planning process.\nE13 - Left care to live\
      \ with parents, relatives, or other person with no parental responsibility \u2013\
      \ this code should be used if the child left care to live with parents, relatives\
      \ or another person, but this person did not have parental responsibility.\n\
      E14 - Accommodation on remand ended \u2013 this code should be used if a child\
      \ was remanded to youth detention accommodation and has stopped their episode\
      \ of care because they are no longer remanded.\nE15 - Age assessment determined\
      \ child is aged 18 or over and E5, E6 and E7 do not apply, for example, an unaccompanied\
      \ asylum seeking child whose age has been disputed \u2013 this code should be\
      \ used if the episode of care ended because the age was disputed, an assessment\
      \ revealed the child was 18 or over and the young person was not transferred\
      \ to residential care and did not move into independent living arrangements.\
      \ E16 - Moved abroad \u2013 use this code if the child left care because they\
      \ moved to another country, including when a child is deported.\nE17 - Aged\
      \ 18 (or over) and remained with current carers (inc under staying put arrangements)\
      \ \u2013 use this code whenever the young person has ceased care and remains\
      \ with their former carers, irrespective of placement type. Young people in\
      \ foster care who are \u2018staying put\u2019 are only a subset of this group.\n\
      E8 - Period of being looked-after ceased for any other reason \u2013 this code\
      \ should never be used purely because a child has reached the age of 18 as this\
      \ can already be deduced from his/her date of birth. It should only be used\
      \ when none of the alternative destinations listed are appropriate. E8 should\

      \ child is sentenced to custody and placed in a secure children\u2019s home,\
      \ secure training centre or young offenders\u2019 institution, their status\

      \ Act 1989) then they remain looked-after regardless of being sentenced to custody.\
      \ If the child is accommodated in care by a voluntary agreement under Section\
      \ 20 of the Children Act 1989, then they cease to be looked-after when they\
      \ are admitted to custody."
