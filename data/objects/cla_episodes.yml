    guidance: "This item records the date that each episode began. For the first episode\
      \ in the year, this date can be in the current data year, or an earlier data\
      \ year. When loading data using CSV or XML, dates must be recorded in a DD/MM/YYYY\
      \ format. Example: 4 November 2023 should be entered as 04/11/2023.\nExceptionally,\
      \ once loaded, the dates in the episode fields will appear as DD/MM/YY (year\
      \ as a 2-digit number). Manual amendments to episode dates may be made using\
      \ either format DD/MM/YY or DD/MM/YYYY, though the latter will appear as DD/MM/YY\
      \ when saved). This is intended to make the episodes easier to read and manually\
      \ amend, particularly when a record contains several episodes.\nWhere episodes\
      \ are consecutive, the new episode must start on the same day that the previous\
      \ episode finished.\nWhen recording an agreement to provide a series of short-term\
      \ placements (legal status V3/V4), enter in this field the date the first placement\
      \ under the agreement began. For further information about children being looked-after\
      \ under a series of short-term placements see Section 1.10.\nWhere an episode\
      \ began in a previous statistical year, but is still open on 31 March, do not\
      \ complete \u2018Reason Episode Ceased\u2019 or \u2018Date Episode Ceased\u2019\
      . The following year\u2019s record must then start with the same episode details\
      \ showing the actual date the episode commenced if the episode subsequently\
      \ closes, both the \u2018Reason Episode Ceased\u2019 and the \u2018Date Episode\
      \ Ceased\u2019 should be recorded).\nEpisodes cannot start and end on the same\
      \ day. If a child has two changes of legal status in one day only the second\
      \ legal status is recorded. Similarly, in the unlikely event of two placements\
      \ starting on the same day, only the status at the end of the day should be\
      \ recorded. In such cases we no longer regard the first move of the day as being\
      \ a placement. It follows from this that an essential component of a placement\
      \ for SSDA903 purposes is that a placement must involve an overnight stay. A\
      \ \u2018placement\u2019 that does not include an overnight stay should be regarded\
      \ as a \u2018visit\u2019 and not shown on the SSDA903."

    guidance: "Use Code S where a child is starting to be looked-after for the first\
      \ time, or had previously ceased to be looked-after, and is now starting to\
      \ be looked-after again. Also use code S when recording agreements to provide\
      \ short-term placements (legal status V4), and for individual breaks under such\
      \ an agreement, if these are being recorded separately (legal status V3).\n\
      Use Code L where there is a change of legal status, but the placement does not\
      \ change. By \u2018legal status\u2019 we mean the legal status underlying the\
      \ fact that the child is looked-after.\nUse Code P where there is a change of\
      \ placement and carer, but the legal status does not change. This would include\
      \ the following scenarios:\n\u2022 Move from one foster carer to another foster\
      \ carer (for example, U3 to another U3 placement type code).\n\u2022 Move from\
      \ a foster carer to a children\u2019s home (for example, U3 to K2 placement\
      \ types).\nIn both scenarios there has been a change of carer. When a child\
      \ is living independently, a new episode should be created each time they move,\
      \ and code P should be used.\nUse Code T where there is a change of placement,\
      \ but the child remains with the same carer and the legal status does not change.\
      \ This would include the following scenarios:\n\u2022 Child moves to a new house\
      \ with current foster carer (either inside or outside of local authority boundary).\n\
      \u2022 Child remains with same carer or within same setting but either the URN\
      \ of the setting changes or the provider type changes (for example, a foster\
      \ carer moves from an IFA to the local authority provider, or a placement for\
      \ adoption transferring to a regional adoption agency, or an unregulated independent\
      \ or semi independent setting registering with Ofsted).\nIn both scenarios,\
      \ the child has remained with the same carer, but for some other reason, a new\
      \ placement is required on the SSDA903.\nUse Code B where both legal status\
      \ and placement change, with a change of carer, on the same day. The two changes\
      \ do not need to be simultaneous or consequent one upon the other. The code\
      \ simply reflects that there was a change in carer and a change in legal status,\
      \ for whatever reason, on the same day.\nUse Code U where both legal status\
      \ and placement change on the same day, but the child remains with the same\
      \ carer. The two changes do not need to be simultaneous or consequent one upon\
      \ the other. The code simply reflects that there was a change in placement and\
      \ a change in legal status, for whatever reason, on the same day."
