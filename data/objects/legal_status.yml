    description: Legal Status
    item_ref: LEG003A
    guidance: "The legal status code on the SSDA903 records the legal status underlying\
      \ being \u2018looked-after\u2019. If a child is looked-after because it is accommodated,\
      \ the legal status goes some way to describe (in legal terms at least) why the\
      \ child is being looked after. There are many legal statuses arising from the\
      \ Children Act, or the Youth Justice System, to which a child can be subject,\
      \ but which have no bearing on whether a child is \u2018looked-after\u2019 or\
      \ not. These are not recorded on the SSDA903, and no legal status codes are\
      \ provided for them.\nThe renewal of an existing legal status does not automatically\
      \ generate a new episode. If the legal status code does not change, a new episode\
      \ is not required (unless there happens to be a change of placement at the same\
      \ time).\nExample: If a child is already looked-after under an interim care\
      \ order, a renewal of the interim care order does not change the legal status\
      \ and no new episode is required. However, if a child looked-after under an\
      \ interim care order becomes the subject of a full care order, then a new episode\
      \ is required to record the start of the full care order.\nIn certain circumstances\
      \ a child being looked-after can have more than one \u2018looked\x02after\u2019\
      \ legal status. In general, this happens when a child who is already \u2018\
      looked-after\u2019 under a Children Act care order comes into contact with the\
      \ Youth Justice System, and as a result is detained in local authority accommodation\
      \ under a second legal status. Two legal statuses cannot be shown as current\
      \ on SSDA903. In such cases the latest legal status should be recorded and the\
      \ episode under the previous status should be closed\nExample: A child who is\
      \ already subject to a care order is remanded to local authority accommodation\
      \ under Section 23 (1) of CYPA 1969. The care order episode should be closed,\
      \ and a new episode should start under the \u201Cremanded to local authority\
      \ accommodation\u201D legal status code. When the episode under the remand status\
      \ ends, a further episode under the care order legal status will start, unless\
      \ the care order has been discharged.\nWe have attempted to identify and provide\
      \ a code for every legal status which theoretically could underpin a child being\
      \ \u2018looked-after\u2019. If future changes in legislation lead to new \u2018\
      looked-after\u2019 legal statuses, we will provide new legal status codes. Our\
      \ analysis of the use of the former legal status code 98 showed that in most\
      \ cases such children were either not looked-after, or that another existing\
      \ legal status was appropriate.\nThe \u2018wardship\u2019 legal status code\
      \ was a possible legal status identified by some local authorities in the consultation\
      \ exercise on the future of the SSDA903 codes for which we did not have an existing\
      \ legal status. However, the use of this code was restricted to just a few exceptional\
      \ cases where the High Court has exercised its residual power to make a child\
      \ a ward of the High Court, and has directed that the child should be accommodated\
      \ by a local authority. In practice such cases werefound to be so extremely\
      \ rare, it was felt that the use of a separate code could not be warranted.\
      \ If such a case should arise, it should be coded C2, as the practical effects\
      \ are the same."
