    guidance: "The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 (DDA) defines a disabled person\
      \ as a person with a physical or mental impairment which has a substantial and\
      \ long-term adverse effect on his/her ability to carry out normal day-to-day\
      \ activities. The condition must have lasted, or be likely to last at least\
      \ 12 months in order to be counted as a disability.\nCode set\nNONE - \u2018\
      NO DISABILITY\u2019\nMOB - \u2018MOBILITY\u2019 \u2013 getting about the house\

      \ as having classical autism or Asperger syndrome. Do not include children who\
      \ have merely been identified as having an autistic spectrum disorder (ASD),\
      \ for example by their school. This can be associated with the behaviour and\
      \ learning categories above.\nDDA - \u2018OTHER DDA\u2019 \u2013 one or more\
      \ of the child\u2019s disabilities under the Disability Discrimination Act 2005\
      \ (DDA) does not fall into any of the above categories. Certain conditions are\
      \ not regarded as impairments for the purposes of the act:\n\u2022 addiction\
      \ to, or dependency on, alcohol, nicotine, or any other substance (other than\
      \ as a result of the substance being medically prescribed);\n\u2022 the condition\

      \ tendency to steal;\n\u2022 tendency to physically or sexually abuse other\
      \ persons;\n\u2022 exhibitionism;\n\u2022 voyeurism\nIn addition, disfigurements\
      \ such as tattoos, non-medical body piercing, or something attached through\
      \ such piercing, are not regarded as having a substantial adverse effect on\
      \ the person\u2019s ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.\nIf a\
      \ child is disabled or becomes disabled at any time during the collection year,\
      \ record all the relevant disabilities that have affected the child. For example,\
      \ children may have multiple disabilities in which case more than one category\
      \ from the below list can be selected. \u2018Other DDA\u2019 can also be used\
      \ in conjunction with any of the other categories.\nIf your MIS does not allow\
      \ for the identification of individual disabilities, then the code \u2018Other\
      \ DDA\u2019 may be used for all children with a disability.\nIf a child has\
      \ no disability, do not leave this item blank; use the code \u2018NONE\u2019\
      . However, if a child is unborn then the disability item should be left blank."
