    guidance: "The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 (DDA) defines a disabled person\
      \ as a person with a physical or mental impairment which has a substantial and\
      \ long-term adverse effect on his/her ability to carry out normal day-to-day\
      \ activities. The condition must have lasted, or be likely to last at least\
      \ 12 months in order to be counted as a disability. Code set NONE - \u2018NO\

      \ - \u2018OTHER DDA\u2019 \u2013 one or more of the child\u2019s disabilities\
      \ under the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 (DDA) does not fall into any\
      \ of the above categories. Certain conditions are not regarded as impairments\

      \ to physically or sexually abuse other persons; \u2022 exhibitionism; \u2022\
      \ voyeurism In addition, disfigurements such as tattoos, non-medical body piercing,\
      \ or something attached through such piercing, are not regarded as having a\
      \ substantial adverse effect on the person\u2019s ability to carry out normal\
      \ day-to-day activities. If a child is disabled or becomes disabled at any time\
      \ during the collection year, record all the relevant disabilities that have\
      \ affected the child. For example, children may have multiple disabilities in\
      \ which case more than one category from the below list can be selected. \u2018\
      Other DDA\u2019 can also be used in conjunction with any of the other categories.\n\
      If your MIS does not allow for the identification of individual disabilities,\
      \ then the code \u2018Other DDA\u2019 may be used for all children with a disability.\
      \ If a child has no disability, do not leave this item blank; use the code \u2018\
      NONE\u2019. However, if a child is unborn then the disability item should be\
      \ left blank."
