    guidance: "The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 (DDA) defines a disabled person\
      \ as a person with a physical or mental impairment which has a substantial and\
      \ long-term adverse effect on his/her ability to carry out normal day-to-day\
      \ activities. The condition must have lasted, or be likely to last at least\
      \ 12 months in order to be counted as a disability.\nCertain conditions are\
      \ not regarded as impairments for the purposes of the act:\n\u2022 addiction\
      \ to, or dependency on, alcohol, nicotine, or any other substance (other than\
      \ as a result of the substance being medically prescribed);\n\u2022 the condition\
      \ known as seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), except where it aggravates\
      \ the effect of another condition;\n\u2022 tendency to start fires;\n\u2022\
      \ tendency to steal;\n\u2022 tendency to physically or sexually abuse other\
      \ persons;\n\u2022 exhibitionism;\n\u2022 voyeurism\nIn addition, disfigurements\
      \ such as tattoos, non-medical body piercing, or something attached through\
      \ such piercing, are not regarded as having a substantial adverse effect on\
      \ the person\u2019s ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.\nIf a\
      \ child is disabled or becomes disabled at any time during the collection year,\
      \ record all the relevant disabilities that have affected the child. For example,\
      \ children may have multiple disabilities in which case more than one category\
      \ from the below list can be selected. \u2018Other DDA\u2019 can also be used\
      \ in conjunction with any of the other categories.\nIf your MIS does not allow\
      \ for the identification of individual disabilities, then the code \u2018Other\
      \ DDA\u2019 may be used for all children with a disability. However, this must\
      \ be recorded in your COLLECT return level notes so your data can be analysed\
      \ appropriately.\nIf a child has no disability, do not leave this item blank;\
      \ use the code \u2018NONE\u2019. However, if a child is unborn then the disability\
      \ item should be left blank."
