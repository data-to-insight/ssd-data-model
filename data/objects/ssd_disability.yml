    guidance: The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 (DDA) defines a disabled person
      as a person with a physical or mental impairment which has a substantial and
      long-term adverse effect on his/her ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.
      The condition must have lasted, or be likely to last at least 12 months in order
      to be counted as a disability.
