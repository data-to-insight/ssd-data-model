    guidance: 'Assessment unique ID from system or auto-generated as part of export.
      Under the Children Act 1989, local authorities are required to provide services
      for children in need for the purposes of safeguarding and promoting their welfare.
      Local authorities undertake assessments of the needs of individual children
      to determine what services to provide and action to take.

      Assessments should be recorded only at significant points such as the beginning
      of a new episode of need. It is not necessary to log new assessments at the
      point of closing an episode of need.

      As set out in ''Working together to safeguard children'' (2018), where the outcome
      of the assessment is continued through an agreed plan of action, the plan should
      be reviewed regularly, the outcomes of these reviews do not need to be recorded.
      However, if the situation changes significantly, this may result in the need
      for the completion of a new assessment, in which case this new assessment should
      be recorded.

      Include all assessments that fall entirely or partly in the 2022 to 2023 collection
      year, including those that had started but had not finished by 31 March 2023,
      and those that started prior to 1 April 2022 and were completed within the 2022
      to 2023 collection year. Please note, if a child is referred to a local authority
      and has been classified as in need following an assessment they should be included
      in the children in need census, regardless of whether they are receiving youth
      offending or any other service.

      Within one working day of a referral being received, a decision should be made
      about the type of response required. The maximum timeframe from the assessment
      to arrive at a decision on the action to be taken should be no longer than 45
      working days from the point of referral. This should be recorded as the end
      date of the assessment. Assessments may lead to no further action, the direct
      provision of services, and section 47 enquiries. See ''Working together to safeguard
      children'' for further information.

      There must always be an assessment actual start date, but if the assessment
      authorisation date falls after the end of the census year, it should be left
      blank. The assessment internal review point date is optional.'
