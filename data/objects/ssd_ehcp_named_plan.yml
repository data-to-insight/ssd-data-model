      This module collects information on the content of the EHC plan, i.e. what is
      in Section I. It should be completed for all existing active EHC plans.

      It is possible that multiple plans may be recorded for a single person. For
      example, if an EHC plan has previously ceased and a further plan has later been
      issued following a new needs assessment. Changes may occur to this section from
      one year to the next for the same person, for example where an establishment
      named on the EHC plan is changed.'
