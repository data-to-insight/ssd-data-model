    guidance: "This code indicates the main reason why a child started to receive\
      \ services. It should not be left blank. Only one reason can be recorded.\n\
      If a child is also looked after, the primary need code for children in need\
      \ might not necessarily be the same as that recorded in the children looked\
      \ after data collection. For example, this may occur if a child became looked\
      \ after at a later date than when they became a child in need.\nThe categories\
      \ are designed only to identify what kind of pressures are placed on social\
      \ services. They have no diagnostic value with regard to the children themselves\
      \ and must not be used to determine what type of service the child should receive.\n\
      If there is difficulty choosing between two or more categories of need, choose\
      \ the category that comes highest up in the table, for example, if trying to\
      \ decide between family in acute stress and family dysfunction, choose family\
      \ in acute stress.\nThe order of the categories relates to the specificity of\
      \ the description and not necessarily importance. However, the order is fixed\
      \ so that there is consistency.\nFurther information on choosing a primary need\
      \ category is in appendix A.\nThe children in need census for 2005 and earlier\
      \ tried to account for all money spent in a census week. To allow for this,\
      \ \u2018N9\u2019 was created, but as this census is specifically child based,\
      \ the definition of \u2018N9\u2019 from 2005 is not applicable. As in previous\
      \ years, \u2018N9\u2019 can be used if a child is no longer in need and the\
      \ only service they are receiving is adoption support (on an open case) immediately\
      \ after they have been in need."

      \ case closed after assessment, referred to early help\u2019.\nThe reason for\
      \ closure code RC8 should be used by local authorities to categorise a case\
      \ for a child who they assess following a referral, but for whom they do not\
      \ provide services and whose case is subsequently closed. It should not be used\
      \ for any other reason.\nThe reason for closure code RC9 should be used by local\
      \ authorities to categorise a case for a child who they assess following a referral,\
      \ but is subsequently referred to early help and whose case is then closed.\n\
      These are different from cases that were closed prior to assessment, at the\
      \ referral stage; the referral no further action flag should be used in these\
      \ cases (see section 4.3). The reason for closure codes RC8 and RC9 should not\
      \ be used for cases that were closed prior to assessment, or for cases where\
      \ services were provided following assessment.\nIn cases where the child has\
      \ been assessed not to be in need after an assessment, the reason for closure\
      \ code RC8 should be used. Where the child has been assessed not to be in need\
      \ after an assessment and then referred to early help, the reason for closure\
      \ code RC9 should be used. If a primary need code is retained on your system\
      \ for these children, then this can be returned using the full code set listed\
      \ in section 4.5. However, if you do not retain a primary need code for some\
      \ or all of these children use code \u2018N0\u2019 for this field. This allows\
      \ for children whose reference data is not completely entered on the system\
      \ and whose need code is yet to be determined, or where the case is a referral\
      \ that has been closed following assessment.\nWhen the reason for closure code\
      \ RC8 or RC9 is used the case should be closed on the same date as the assessment\
      \ ends or, if this is not practical, as soon as possible afterwards."

      \ A children in need closure date can be the same as the referral date but,\
      \ in practice, this should only very rarely occur. Closure date is not required\
      \ for a referral that leads to no further action.\n- Children in need closure\
      \ in the case of adoption\nWhen a child\u2019s case is closed because of adoption\
      \ (reason for closure code \u2018RC1\u2019), the children in need closure date\
      \ will normally be the day when the court granted the adoption order.\nIt is\
      \ recognised that an adoption case may sometimes remain open to allow all procedures\
      \ to be completed. In this situation the census will allow for the case to extend\
      \ up to one month after the date of the adoption order without having to open\
      \ a new record. The need code would stay the same in these cases. Anything above\
      \ one month will require a new record to be created. If a child remains in need\
      \ after being adopted from care, then the new post-adoption child record should\
      \ be opened with a children in need referral date that is the date of the court\u2019\
      s adoption order. If the child is receiving post-adoption support, it should\
      \ be recorded in this new record.\n- Children in need closure in the case of\
      \ death\nWhen a child is no longer in need because the child dies or an unborn\
      \ child is stillborn (reason for closure code \u2018RC2\u2019), the closure\
      \ date and the date of death recorded on the death certificate no longer need\
      \ to match. It is recognised that the case may remain open for investigation\
      \ and review procedures after the child dies; the date of death field allows\
      \ local authorities to separately record the date of death and final case closure\
      \ date in the census. This will allow local authorities to record the services\
      \ they provide between the death and the case closure."
