    guidance: "Missing Episode record unique ID from system or auto-generated as part\
      \ of export. This module collects data on children who are missing from care\
      \ or away from their placement without authorisation. All such episodes should\
      \ be recorded, regardless of duration, along with the start/end date of the\
      \ incident. Additional Notes\nIf a missing from care or away from placement\
      \ without authorisation episode starts and ends within the same day, then the\
      \ same date should be returned for the start and end dates. Similarly, if more\
      \ than one missing episode occurs within the same day, separate episodes should\
      \ be recorded but these should have the same start/end dates.\nIf a child is\
      \ away from placement without authorisation, but they subsequently become missing\
      \ (meaning their whereabouts become unknown), this should be recorded as two\
      \ separate episodes, but the end date of the away from placement without authorisation\
      \ episode should be the same as the start date of the missing episode. This\
      \ should be the point at which the child\u2019s whereabouts became unknown.\
      \ Equally, there may be some circumstances where the whereabouts of a missing\
      \ child become known such that he/she is no longer considered to be missing,\
      \ but the child is still not where they are supposed to be. A new \u2018away\
      \ from placement without authorisation\u2019 episode should be recorded, and\
      \ this would have a start date consistent with the date of the end of the missing\
      \ episode. This should be the date the child\u2019s whereabouts became known.\n\
      For children who start to be looked-after when missing, record the placement\
      \ arranged for the child had the child not been missing, then add details of\
      \ the missing child to the missing module.\nIf a child ceases to be looked-after\
      \ whilst still missing (for example they turn 18) then please enter an end date\
      \ for the missing/away from placement without authorisation which is equal to\
      \ the date the child ceased to be looked-after."
