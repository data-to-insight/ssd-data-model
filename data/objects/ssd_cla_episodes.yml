      \ at the same time\nU - Change of legal status and change of placement (but\
      \ same carer(s)) at the same time Use Code S where a child is starting to be\
      \ looked-after for the first time, or had previously ceased to be looked-after,\
      \ and is now starting to be looked-after again. Also use code S when recording\
      \ agreements to provide short-term placements (legal status V4), and for individual\
      \ breaks under such an agreement, if these are being recorded separately (legal\
      \ status V3).\nUse Code L where there is a change of legal status, but the placement\
      \ does not change. By \u2018legal status\u2019 we mean the legal status underlying\
      \ the fact that the child is looked-after.\nUse Code P where there is a change\
      \ of placement and carer, but the legal status does not change. This would include\
      \ the following scenarios:\n\u2022 Move from one foster carer to another foster\
      \ carer (for example, U3 to another U3 placement type code).\n\u2022 Move from\
      \ a foster carer to a children\u2019s home (for example, U3 to K2 placement\
      \ types).\nIn both scenarios there has been a change of carer. When a child\
      \ is living independently, a new episode should be created each time they move,\
      \ and code P should be used.\nUse Code T where there is a change of placement,\
      \ but the child remains with the same carer and the legal status does not change.\
      \ This would include the following scenarios:\n\u2022 Child moves to a new house\
      \ with current foster carer (either inside or outside of local authority boundary).\n\
      \u2022 Child remains with same carer or within same setting but either the URN\
      \ of the setting changes or the provider type changes (for example, a foster\
      \ carer moves from an IFA to the local authority provider, or a placement for\
      \ adoption transferring to a regional adoption agency, or an unregulated independent\
      \ or semi independent setting registering with Ofsted).\nIn both scenarios,\
      \ the child has remained with the same carer, but for some other reason, a new\
      \ placement is required on the SSDA903.\nUse Code B where both legal status\
      \ and placement change, with a change of carer, on the same day. The two changes\
      \ do not need to be simultaneous or consequent one upon the other. The code\
      \ simply reflects that there was a change in carer and a change in legal status,\
      \ for whatever reason, on the same day.\nUse Code U where both legal status\
      \ and placement change on the same day, but the child remains with the same\
      \ carer. The two changes do not need to be simultaneous or consequent one upon\
      \ the other. The code simply reflects that there was a change in placement and\
      \ a change in legal status, for whatever reason, on the same day."

      \ occur within the planned timeframe. This would include instances where a child\
      \ under a voluntary arrangement is removed from care by their parents and this\
      \ was not agreed as part of the care planning process.\nE13 - Left care to live\
      \ with parents, relatives, or other person with no parental responsibility \u2013\
      \ this code should be used if the child left care to live with parents, relatives\
      \ or another person, but this person did not have parental responsibility.\n\
      E14 - Accommodation on remand ended \u2013 this code should be used if a child\
      \ was remanded to youth detention accommodation and has stopped their episode\
      \ of care because they are no longer remanded.\nE15 - Age assessment determined\
      \ child is aged 18 or over and E5, E6 and E7 do not apply, for example, an unaccompanied\
      \ asylum seeking child whose age has been disputed \u2013 this code should be\
      \ used if the episode of care ended because the age was disputed, an assessment\
      \ revealed the child was 18 or over and the young person was not transferred\
      \ to residential care and did not move into independent living arrangements.\
      \ E16 - Moved abroad \u2013 use this code if the child left care because they\
      \ moved to another country, including when a child is deported.\nE17 - Aged\
      \ 18 (or over) and remained with current carers (inc under staying put arrangements)\
      \ \u2013 use this code whenever the young person has ceased care and remains\
      \ with their former carers, irrespective of placement type. Young people in\
      \ foster care who are \u2018staying put\u2019 are only a subset of this group.\n\
      E8 - Period of being looked-after ceased for any other reason \u2013 this code\
      \ should never be used purely because a child has reached the age of 18 as this\
      \ can already be deduced from his/her date of birth. It should only be used\
      \ when none of the alternative destinations listed are appropriate. E8 should\
      \ also be used when a child turns 18 and continues to be missing.\nIf a looked-after\
      \ child is sentenced to custody and placed in a secure children\u2019s home,\
      \ secure training centre or young offenders\u2019 institution, their status\
      \ in that setting depends on the legislative framework under which the custodial\
      \ sentence is applied. If the child is subject to a Care Order (Section 31 Children\
      \ Act 1989) then they remain looked-after regardless of being sentenced to custody.\
      \ If the child is accommodated in care by a voluntary agreement under Section\
      \ 20 of the Children Act 1989, then they cease to be looked-after when they\
      \ are admitted to custody."
