    guidance: "Record the factors as understood at the end of the assessment relevant\
      \ to:\n\u2022 the impairment of the child\u2019s health and development (\u2018\
      Child\u2019);\n\u2022 the parent(s)/carer(s) capacity to respond to the child\u2019\
      s needs (\u2018Parenting capacity\u2019);\n\u2022 other people in the family/household,\
      \ for example, a sibling or lodger (\u2018Other\u2019). This applies to all\
      \ assessments completed. The information should be recorded at the end of the\
      \ assessment and all factors which are felt to be relevant to the child\u2019\
      s assessment should be reported from the list below. This includes factors where\
      \ services are put in place to mitigate the effect of the factor as well as\
      \ factors which need to be taken into account in providing other support. Please\
      \ only record factors which are currently an issue of concern. For example,\
      \ if domestic violence is a current issue of concern, please record it. If domestic\
      \ violence was an issue in a previous relationship and is not an issue of concern\
      \ now, then do not record it. Factors such as mental health concerns do not\
      \ need to be confined to medically defined conditions. Rather this is intended,\
      \ for example, to record where the professional, as part of the assessment process,\
      \ feels that mental health is of concern to the child\u2019s health and development\
      \ or parenting capacity to respond to the child\u2019s needs. Code 21 (no factors\
      \ identified) should only be used for cases which are closed following assessments\
      \ which result in no further action (closure code RC8 and RC9) and should be\
      \ the only factor listed. However, if factors are identified for cases which\
      \ are closed following assessment, please record these selecting from the list\
      \ above, but excluding code 21. If a section 47 enquiry has commenced on a case,\
      \ then code 21 (no factors identified) should not be reported at the end of\
      \ assessment even if it was found that the allegations that triggered the section\
      \ 47 enquiry are unfounded. Instead, the relevant factors that were considered\
      \ at the assessment that initiated the section 47 enquiry should be recorded.\
      \ The case should then be closed using the reason for closure code: \u2018RC7\
      \ - services ceased for any other reason, including child no longer in need\u2019\
      , as at the point the section 47 started the child would be counted as a child\
      \ in need even if the case closed shortly after. Code 21 should only be used\
      \ in cases where the section 47 enquiry was automatically triggered alongside\
      \ the assessment and both the assessment and section 47 resulted in no further\
      \ action. More detailed descriptions and definitions of the factors are provided\
      \ in the \u2018Additional guide on the factors identified at the end of assessment\u2019\
      \ for more information. The additional guide is available as part of the Children\
      \ in need census: guide to submitting data."
