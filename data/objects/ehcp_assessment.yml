    guidance: "EHCP assessment record unique ID from system or auto-generated as part\
      \ of export. This module collects information on the decision to issue a plan.\
      \ Where a decision has been made to issue a plan, the detail about the placement\
      \ named on the EHC plan should be recorded in Module 4. It is possible that\
      \ multiple assessments may be recorded for a single person. For example, if\
      \ it was decided not to issue a plan previously and a new assessment has been\
      \ agreed following a new request.\nIf a child or young person transfers into\
      \ the local authority\u2019s area during the assessment process before an EHC\
      \ plan has been issued there is no right of transfer of decisions made by the\
      \ originating local authority. Under good practice local authorities may decide\
      \ to share information but the importing local authority must make its own decisions\
      \ on whether to assess and whether to issue a plan.\nWhere a person with an\
      \ existing EHC plan transfers into the local authority\u2019s area (item 5.1)\
      \ the assessment should be recorded as historical by the importing local authority,\
      \ even if the EHC plan start date is within the collection year."
