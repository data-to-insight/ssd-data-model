    guidance: "Evidence suggests that mental health problems are over four times more\
      \ likely for children looked after compared to their peers. Carers continue\
      \ to report that they find it difficult to access appropriate child and adolescent\
      \ mental health services. The Government sees it as critical to address the\
      \ issue of mental health of children looked-after to improve both their outcomes\
      \ and life chances. This data item covers the emotional and behavioural health\
      \ of children looked-after, as recorded by a main carer in the strengths and\
      \ difficulties questionnaire (SDQ).\nStatutory guidance on promoting the health\
      \ and well-being of looked-after children issued under Section 7 of the Local\
      \ Authority Social Services Act 1970 sets out that all local authorities are\
      \ required (paragraphs 14, 47 and Annex B) to make sure that a strengths and\
      \ difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) is completed for each of their children looked\
      \ after aged between 4-16 inclusive. As well as providing data at a national\
      \ level on the emotional and behavioural health of children looked after, the\
      \ SDQ also provides valuable information as part of a child\u2019s annual health\
      \ assessment. So it should not be seen purely as a data collection exercise.\
      \ Its primary purpose is to give social workers and health professionals information\
      \ about a child\u2019s wellbeing.\nWhile local authorities may use other screening/diagnostic\
      \ tools in addition to the SDQ to monitor the emotional/mental health of their\
      \ children looked after, nevertheless they must carry out the SDQ assessment\
      \ in line with the above guidance. Unless a carer refuses to complete an SDQ\
      \ a score should be returned for every child looked-after.\nData submitted\n\
      Local authorities will collect data through a standard strengths and difficulties\
      \ questionnaire. A single score (0\u201340), or a reason for the score not being\
      \ returned is required for each child looked-after continuously for at least\
      \ 12 months aged 4\u201316 on the date of the last assessment."
