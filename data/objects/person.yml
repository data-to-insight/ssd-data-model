      1 - Female child is a mother

      The motherhood status should be entered for all girls, this includes those currently
      looked-after and girls who have ceased to be looked-after.

      For girls who cease to be looked-after during the year ending 31 March, local
      authorities are asked to indicate whether each looked-after girl was a mother
      (1 = yes, 0 = no) at the time of being looked-after. A girl who ceased to be
      looked-after in the year ending 31 March 2024 should only be recorded as a mother
      if her child/children was/were born before she left care. The only exception
      to this is if the pregnancy did not result in a live birth or if the girl was
      looked-after under an agreed series of short-term placements.

      Only data on live births is required (data on pregnancies that do not result
      in a live birth will not be collected). Live births exclude miscarriages and
      still births but include neo-natal deaths (which occur within 28 days of birth).
      A child should be

      classified as a mother even if they do not care for the child themselves (for
      example, if consent was given for the child to be adopted).'
