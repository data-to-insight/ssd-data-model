    guidance: 'Was the conference quorate?

      The primary principle for determining quoracy is that there should be sufficient
      agencies or key disciplines present to enable safe decisions to be made in the
      individual circumstances. Minimum representation is Children''s Social Care
      and at least two other agencies or key disciplines that have had direct contact
      with the child and family. In a case relating to fabricated or induced illness,
      it is important to ensure the paediatrician is able to attend.'
