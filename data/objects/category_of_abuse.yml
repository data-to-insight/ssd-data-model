    guidance: "Using the code set in the table below record the category of abuse\
      \ as assessed when the child protection plan commenced and any subsequent category\
      \ of abuse assigned to the child protection plan. The latest category of abuse\
      \ may be the same as the initial category of abuse. -NEG Neglect\n-PHY Physical\
      \ abuse\n-SAB Sexual abuse\n-EMO Emotional abuse\n-MUL Multiple/not recommended\
      \ The multiple category is for when more than one category of abuse is relevant\
      \ to the child\u2019s current protection plan. It is not intended to record\
      \ information for children who have been the subject of more than one child\
      \ protection plan during the year.\nThe category of abuse under which a child\
      \ is made the subject of a child protection plan will have been decided upon\
      \ at the child protection conference. However, if the category of abuse applicable\
      \ to the current child protection plan has changed as a result of subsequent\
      \ child protection conferences, then enter the latest category of abuse. Overall,\
      \ the initial category of abuse is that decided upon at the conference; any\
      \ amended category is to be recorded as the latest category of abuse. The categories\
      \ are defined for the purpose of this collection as follows:\n-Neglect\nNeglect\
      \ is the persistent failure to meet a child\u2019s basic physical and/or psychological\
      \ needs, which is likely to result in the serious impairment of the child\u2019\
      s health or development. For instance, a parent or carer may fail to:\n\u2022\
      \ provide adequate food, shelter, or clothing (including exclusion from home\
      \ or abandonment);\n\u2022 protect a child from physical harm, emotional harm,\
      \ or danger;\n\u2022 ensure adequate supervision (including the use of inadequate\
      \ care-givers);\n\u2022 ensure access to appropriate medical care or treatment.\n\
      It may also include neglect of, or unresponsiveness to, a child\u2019s basic\
      \ emotional needs.\nMore information on childhood neglect including training\
      \ and resource materials can be found in Safeguarding children."
