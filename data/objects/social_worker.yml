      \ digits.\nWhere a child\u2019s primary social worker/caseworker is a qualified\
      \ social worker, for each episode record the child and family social worker\
      \ Social Work England (SWE) number (formerly HCPC code). For social workers\
      \ this will start \u2018SW\u2019. This will allow us to link to the Children\u2019\
      s Social Work Workforce Census, for example to pick up information on social\

      \ as being qualified in Scotland) please provide an alternative unique identifier\

      \ open social worker episode prior to the start of the collection period) Reason\
      \ for social worker change: Notes and definitions\n-MANAGE \u2013 Managing caseloads\n\
      Child transferred to a new social worker to balance social worker caseloads.\
      \ This could be because the previous social worker\u2019s caseload was too high,\
      \ or the newly assigned social worker needed new cases.\nThis code should also\
      \ be used where a social worker has been covering a social worker absence, but\
      \ the child\u2019s case does not return to the absent social worker on their\
      \ return but another social worker. For example, an agency worker has been covering\
      \ a maternity leave absence but the child\u2019s case is then transferred to\
      \ another social worker rather than the social worker returning from maternity\
      \ leave.\nThis code should also be used in situations where a team leader has\
      \ been holding a child\u2019s case until a new primary social worker is allocated.\n\
      -FCONTA \u2013 First contact or re-referral\nThis code should be used for the\
      \ first social worker assigned to the child within the local authority, or the\
      \ first social worker assigned to the child following a re-referral to the local\
      \ authority, where the child had previously left the care of the local authority.\
      \ If a child\u2019s case is initially held on a temporary basis for administrative\
      \ purposes, for example, an \u2018on duty team manager\u2019 or a \u2018referral\
      \ worker\u2019, before being assigned a social worker, then this should not\
      \ be included. This initial process will be different for all local authorities,\
      \ but as a general principle, please record the first social worker episode\
      \ as the one in which the social worker will begin to have direct contact with\
      \ the child.\n-LEFTRL \u2013 Previous social worker left role\nUse this code\
      \ when the previous social worker left their current role, either to take up\
      \ a new role in the local authority (including promotion or internal transfer),\
      \ or left the local authority, and so a new social worker was assigned to the\
      \ child.\n-ORGRST \u2013 New social worker assigned following organisational\
      \ restructure\nChild transferred to a new social worker following an organisational\
      \ restructure.\n-TSPROC \u2013 New social worker assigned following child transfer\
      \ due to standard process\nChild transferred to a new social worker following\
      \ a transfer to another service within the local authority, for example from\
      \ an assessment team to a CIN team, or a move from the CIN team to the long-term\
      \ CLA services.\nABSENC \u2013 Absence cover or return from absence\nPrevious\
      \ social worker is on leave and a new social worker is assigned to formally\
      \ 'hold' the child's case, e.g. previous social worker is on long term annual\
      \ or sick leave, maternity, paternity, adoption or bereavement leave, sabbatical,\
      \ or other absence.\nThis code should also be used when a social worker is reassigned\
      \ a case following their return from an absence, during which another social\
      \ worker was formally 'holding' the child's case. For example a social worker\
      \ returns from maternity leave and is reassigned their previous cases.\nIf the\
      \ primary social worker is temporarily absent (e.g. annual leave, etc.), this\
      \ should not be recorded as a change in social worker episode unless they are\
      \ no longer \u2018holding\u2019 the child\u2019s case and a new primary social\
      \ worker is formally \u2018holding\u2019 it.\nCHCHAN \u2013 Child requested\
      \ change from previous social worker\nThe relationship between the child and\
      \ social worker has broken down or been disrupted and the child has asked to\
      \ change to another social worker.\nPCCHAN \u2013 Parent/carer requested change\
      \ from previous social worker\nThe relationship between the child and/or parent\
      \ or carer and the social worker has broken down or been disrupted and their\
      \ parent or carer [foster carer, residential unit or connected person] has asked\
      \ to change to another social worker.\nSWDIED \u2013 Previous social worker\

      \ reason not captured above, including no reason found. To sign off your data,\
      \ additional information will need to be added to your return to explain any\
      \ reasons you report as other.\nThis code should also be used for the first\
      \ social worker episode of the year if it was already open prior to the start\
      \ of the collection period. For this specific reason, the child_id should be\
      \ recorded in the additional information alongside the following wording: \u2018\
      Social worker episode already open prior to 1 April\u2019. If a new social worker\
      \ episode begins on the 1 April then this should be recorded separately with\
      \ the relevant reason provided."
