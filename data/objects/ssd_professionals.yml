    guidance: "A social worker ID code will allow identification of episodes with\
      \ the same social worker and will allow us to link social workers across episodes.\
      \ This data item should be in the format \u2018AAnnnnnn\u2019 and is up to 12\
      \ digits.\nWhere a child\u2019s primary social worker/caseworker is a qualified\
      \ social worker, for each episode record the child and family social worker\
      \ Social Work England (SWE) number (formerly HCPC code). For social workers\
      \ this will start \u2018SW\u2019. This will allow us to link to the Children\u2019\
      s Social Work Workforce Census, for example to pick up information on social\
      \ worker characteristics.\nWhere this primary social worker is not a qualified\
      \ social worker (or does not have an SWE number for another reason \u2013 such\
      \ as being qualified in Scotland) please provide an alternative unique identifier\
      \ for the worker. This can be any alphanumeric code though should start with\
      \ \u2018XX\u2019 to prevent inadvertent matching with the Social Primary social\
      \ worker The \u2018primary social worker\u2019 is the primary member of local\
      \ authority staff responsible for managing the child\u2019s case. This may be\
      \ known across authorities as \u2018allocated case worker\u2019, \u2018key worker\u2019\
      \ or \u2018lead practitioner\u2019. Please note: for episodes where a child\
      \ is not in care this may also include non-qualified social workers/caseworkers\
      \ without a Social Work England (SWE) number.\nIt should also be consistent\
      \ across the social worker\u2019s episodes in the data. Likewise, this should\
      \ be done if a primary social worker is a qualified worker but it is not possible\
      \ to provide their SWE number.\nWhere a worker has qualified in year or their\
      \ SWE number has changed during the year, please use their latest SWE number\
      \ for all episodes."
