    guidance: If the UPN is unknown, then one of the codes below should be used. If
      a child is educated outside England, please use UPN unknown code UN3, unless
      the child has a UPN from previously attending a school in England. If the child
      is home educated and has previously attended a mainstream school, please provide
      the UPN allocated earlier. Code set UN1 - Child looked-after is not of school
      age and has not yet been assigned a UPN UN2 - Child looked-after has never attended
      a maintained school in England (for example, some unaccompanied asylum-seeking
      children (UASC)) UN3 - Child looked-after is educated outside England UN4 -
      Child is newly looked-after and the UPN is not yet known UN5 - Sources collating
      UPNs reflect discrepancy(ies) for the child's name and/or surname and/or date
      of birth therefore preventing reliable matching (for example, duplicated UPNs)
