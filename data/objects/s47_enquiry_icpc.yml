    guidance: 'This item refers to enquiries conducted under the provisions of section
      47 of the Children Act 1989. The objective of such enquiries is to determine
      whether action is needed to promote and safeguard the welfare of the child or
      children who are the subject of the enquiries. An assessment should also be
      recorded on each occasion a child is subject to a section 47 enquiry.

      We are aware that in some local authorities a section 47 enquiry is automatically
      triggered alongside the assessment. In these cases, where both resulted in no
      further action, a section 47 should not be recorded. Enter the date of the strategy
      discussion at which the section 47 enquiries were initiated, using the formatting
      covered in the general notes. This can be a non-working day.'
