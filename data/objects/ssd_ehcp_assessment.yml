      \ ID from system or auto-generated as part of export. This module collects information\
      \ on the decision to issue a plan. Where a decision has been made to issue a\
      \ plan, the detail about the placement named on the EHC plan should be recorded\
      \ in Module 4. It is possible that multiple assessments may be recorded for\
      \ a single person. For example, if it was decided not to issue a plan previously\
      \ and a new assessment has been agreed following a new request.\nIf a child\
      \ or young person transfers into the local authority\u2019s area during the\
      \ assessment process before an EHC plan has been issued there is no right of\
      \ transfer of decisions made by the originating local authority. Under good\
      \ practice local authorities may decide to share information but the importing\
      \ local authority must make its own decisions on whether to assess and whether\
      \ to issue a plan.\nWhere a person with an existing EHC plan transfers into\
      \ the local authority\u2019s area (item 5.1) the assessment should be recorded\
      \ as historical by the importing local authority, even if the EHC plan start\
      \ date is within the collection year."
