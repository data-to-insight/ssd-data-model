    guidance: "Select the code which most accurately answers the question \u2013 was\
      \ the local authority in touch with this young person?\nFor young people aged\
      \ 17 to 21 years, to be counted as \u2018in touch\u2019 for the purposes of\
      \ this data item, there should be \u201Ccontact\u201D between your local authority\
      \ and the young person around 3 months before and one month after the young\
      \ person\u2019s birthday..\nFor young people aged 22 to 25 to be counted as\
      \ \u2018in touch\u2019 for the purposes of this data item, they should have\
      \ contacted your local authority for support at some point during the year.\n\
      The OC3 data collection is designed to monitor the situation of young people\
      \ when they have left care, rather than their situation immediately before they\
      \ left care. Because the guidance says that the local authority should be in\
      \ touch with the young person in the period three months before, to one month\
      \ after the birthday, it is possible that the local authority will have been\
      \ in touch with the young person while they were still in care.\nIf the birthday\
      \ in question is the 17th birthday, then it should be recorded whether the local\
      \ authority was in touch with the young person AFTER they had left care. Information\
      \ should be returned if the young person left care before or on their 17th birthday,\
      \ but not if they left care after their 17th birthday.\nIf the birthday in question\
      \ is the 18th birthday, then we want to know whether your local authority is\
      \ in touch with the person AFTER they left care and at some point up to 3 months\
      \ after their 18th birthday. The accommodation and activity should reflect the\
      \ most up to date information you have available up to the age of 18 years and\
      \ 3 months. Information should be returned for young people who turned 18 in\
      \ the year and left care before or on their 18th birthday.\nIf your local authority\
      \ is in contact more than once during the relevant time period, the most up\
      \ to date information on the last occasion of contact should be recorded for\
      \ activity and accommodation.\nStatutory guidance is clear that the Personal\
      \ Adviser (PA) must have regular face to face contact with every care leaver\
      \ they support. The pathway plan must set out expectations for the PA to see\
      \ the care leaver and, if relevant, arrangements for staying in touch in other\
      \ ways, which could include regular exchanges of text messages, emails and phone\
      \ conversations between the PA and the young person. Further guidance on keeping\
      \ in touch is given in chapter 4 of the Planning Transitions to Adulthood Guidance\
      \ for Care Leavers.\nFor care leavers aged 17- to 21-years-old, if your local\
      \ authority has contacted a young person, and the young person has responded\
      \ by stating that they have no desire to supply your local authority with any\
      \ information, and do not want to be contacted by your local authority again,\
      \ this is should be coded as REFU - \u201Cyoung person refuses contact\u201D\
      . Similarly, if the young person has moved outside the local authority boundary\
      \ and has chosen not to tell the local authority where they have gone, you still\
      \ need to have been in communication with the young person to be able to count\
      \ them as \u201Cin touch\u201D.\nWhere a young person has previously been receiving\
      \ Leaving Care Services but has now decided that they no longer require a service,\
      \ this should be coded as NREQ \u2013 \u201Cyoung person no longer requires\
      \ services\u201D. NREQ should also be used for young people aged 22 years old\
      \ and over who have not taken up the offer of Personal Adviser support.\nNote,\
      \ if the young person died (since leaving care) following their relevant birthday\
      \ in the collection year, the information as at their last birthday should be\
      \ provided including whether they were in touch or not at that point. If the\
      \ young person died before their relevant birthday in the collection year, the\
      \ code \u201CDIED\u201D should be used. If a young person died whilst in care,\
      \ OC3 information is not required.\nChildren who have returned to live with\
      \ parents or someone with parental responsibility for a period of more than\
      \ 6 months are no longer \u2018relevant children\u2019 so the \u2018in touch\u2019\
      \ code used should be RHOM. However, if this arrangement then breaks down and\
      \ the young person ceases to live with the person concerned, he/she once again\
      \ becomes a \u2018relevant child\u2019 and \u2018RHOM\u2019 should not be used.\
      \ Code set for in touch:\n- YES Yes - in touch\n- NO No \u2013 not in touch\n\
      -DIED Died after leaving care\n-REFU Young person refuses contact\n-NREQ Young\
      \ person no longer requires children\u2019s social care services\n-RHOM Young\
      \ person returned to live with parents or someone with parental responsibility\
      \ for a continuous period of 6 months or more Contact through a third party\
      \ is acceptable if you are satisfied that this represents a genuine exchange\
      \ of information between the care leaver and your local authority. It is your\
      \ responsibility to judge whether such contact is sufficient to qualify for\
      \ definition as \u2018in touch\u2019. For example, if someone mentions that\
      \ they have met the young person in passing and the young person appeared well,\
      \ then this is not defined as \u2018in touch\u2019. However, if a third person\
      \ passes a note from the young person to your local authority, then this would\
      \ be classified as being \u2018in touch\u2019.\nContact through a third party\
      \ who is working with the care leaver in a professional capacity is classified\
      \ as \u2018in touch\u2019; for example, a young person\u2019s advisor not directly\
      \ employed by your local authority. It is expected that contact through a third\
      \ person who works with care leavers in a professional capacity will be frequent."
