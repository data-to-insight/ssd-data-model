	/*(currently 'PLACEHOLDER_DATA' pending further development) 
	EHCP assessment record unique ID from system or auto-generated as part of export. 
	This module collects information on the decision to issue a plan. Where a decision has been made to issue a plan, the detail about the placement named on the EHC plan should be recorded in Module 4. It is possible that multiple assessments may be recorded for a single person. For example, if it was decided not to issue a plan previously and a new assessment has been agreed following a new request.
	If a child or young person transfers into the local authority’s area during the assessment process before an EHC plan has been issued there is no right of transfer of decisions made by the originating local authority. Under good practice local authorities may decide to share information but the importing local authority must make its own decisions on whether to assess and whether to issue a plan.
	Where a person with an existing EHC plan transfers into the local authority’s area (item 5.1) the assessment should be recorded as historical by the importing local authority, even if the EHC plan start date is within the collection year. */

	-A   Decision has not yet been made

	If a local authority decides not to issue an EHC plan and this decision is subsequently changed by the local authority for any reason the original assessment outcome and assessment outcome date should not be changed. If the change follows from mediation or tribunal the appropriate mediation and tribunal indicators should be selected for the assessment. 
	W may include where the person moves out of the local authority area, leaves education or training or if the child or young person dies. 
	Where A or W is selected, no further information is required in this or subsequent modules. The 20-week timeliness measure will not apply in cases where a plan has not yet been issued.
	For an active plan, where the decision to issue was made before the latest collection period (H - Historical) information is still required on the plan itself. */
